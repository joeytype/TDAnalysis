Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-02-20 12:00:00+00:00	Nomination of Taoiseach	1	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus guím comhghairdeas air freisin as a bheith tofa. Táim an-sásta an deis seo a ghlacadh tacú le hainmniúchán an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald mar Thaoiseach. Is mór an onóir agus an phribhléid dom é sin a dhéanamh.  I am very happy to support the nomination of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to the position of Taoiseach because I believe it reflects entirely the mandate given to this Dáil and my party, Sinn Féin. In particular, I believe it is the mandate given to the Deputy by the people of Ireland on 8 February who want her to be Taoiseach.  Many commentators said the general election result was seismic and I agree. There can be no doubt about it. The election was uplifting, positive and liberating. This was an election full of hope for a better and brighter future and it prescribed a clear mandate and message for us today. People are hungry for change and, throughout the election campaign, they said enough was enough. They said that as a country and people, we deserve better and we demand better. I think everyone in this Chamber can agree on that. They said we deserve better in health and housing - the national scandals. However, they also said they wanted a break from sitting in congested traffic; from public services that do not exist, work or make sense; and from working from morning to night not seeing their kids during the week but not having the few spare euro needed to treat them at the weekend. This is the life, or the existence, created for them by previous Governments and they want change. On 8 February, the people spoke. Hundreds of thousands of them came out and voted for change like never before. More than 530,000 people voted for Sinn Féin alone. As a result, as we enter the early months of a new decade, people are now more hopeful than ever that change is possible. They are more hopeful that politics and politicians will deliver that change. They do not expect miracles but they will not accept excuses. They know enough about the world and have seen it done well elsewhere so they know their demands are entirely reasonable and realisable.   This Dáil has an unprecedented mandate for change. More than any other party, Sinn Féin is the party that received that mandate for change. More than any other leader, Deputy McDonald is the leader who received that mandate for change. Deputy McDonald would be in every way a fitting Taoiseach. She has shown that in spades. This is a unique opportunity in the history of our country. I urge Teachtaí to support Deputy McDonald for Taoiseach to lead a Government for change and to implement a programme for change that is fitting for the clear wishes of the Irish people. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-06 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Tourism): Statements	1	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute. I am sharing time with Teachta Cullinane and Teachta Daly - five minutes each.  When we heard on the news over the weekend that tourism was among the sectors worst hit by the Covid-19 job losses, it came as confirmation for most of us rather than a surprise. The sector is crucial. In many areas it is the beating heart of local economies but, dependent as it is on the movement of people, it has been decimated by Covid-19. The tourism and hospitality sector supports an estimated 260,000 jobs in Ireland. That is 11% of total employment, making it our largest local employer, and it has reached into every region and county. Some 70% of jobs in the sector are outside Dublin - 6,500 of them are in my county of Meath - highlighting the regional contribution of tourism and its vital role in spreading employment opportunities and prosperity across the entire country.  In recent weeks we have seen pubs and restaurants, shops, hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast premises, museums, galleries, theatres, visitor centres, tour operators - the list goes on - closed, many with hundreds of employees who have thousands of years of combined working experience. For many, it is a lifetime's work. I extend my solidarity to those workers at this uncertain time.  If the economic impact is great, I suggest that the social impact is many times that. Festivals, events and places that bring people together are all out of bounds. These are matters of the greatest importance. Literally hundreds of thousands of workers and their families - entire communities in some cases - are waiting in anticipation.  I have two questions for the Minister of State. We need a dedicated recovery plan for the tourism and hospitality sector. The business supports announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the weekend do not go anywhere near far enough. They are not ambitious enough, focused enough or extensive enough. Will the Minister of State commit to the establishment of a tourism recovery task force to develop and deliver a dedicated tourism recovery package? In his opening statement, he made reference to looking at the structures. Will a tourism recovery task force be part of that? Will he outline a timeline for the delivery of that?  Separately, our air and sea ports are the vital lifelines for the tourism and hospitality sector and we want to see them thrive but there are concerns that essential Covid-19 precautions are not being implemented. It is suggested that entrants are not being screened and followed up, and social media magnifies that. Will the Minister of State outline the plans in place to ensure that ports and airports will not act as Covid-19 vectors and will be ready to respond to the increased traffic that we hope to see in the coming weeks and months?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-13 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Cronin and Wynne. We will respectively take seven minutes, four minutes and four minutes. If the Minister does not mind, I will ask some questions and request a response, and we might go back and forth.  My first question concerns the Covid-19 checks and the controls at our ports and airports, particularly the latter. We know that our airports have never been quieter. Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were down by 57% in March, and possibly by as much as 90% in all Irish airports last month. Despite these low passenger numbers, the current system of Covid-19 checks and controls, including the public health passenger locator form, has proven entirely inadequate. It is reported that approximately one third of passengers do not fill out the form and a further one third do not answer follow-up calls. We know that Ryanair wants to resume 40% of flights from 1 January. This could lead to significantly increased passenger numbers at our airports at a time when the citizens of Ireland are supposed to be staying within 20 km of our homes. We also know that the European Commission is today publishing a strategy paper on resuming leisure travel in a safe and co-ordinated manner. Will the Minister acknowledge that the current system of checks and controls at our ports and airports is not fit for purpose? Will he assure people that public health advice, and not the commercial interests of airlines, the European Commission or anybody else, will determine transport policy at ports and airports at this time? Will he outline the measures that will be introduced to ensure the very highest standards of Covid-19 checks and controls at our ports and airports as we progress through the different phases of relaxation? Are protocols being developed? Are temperature checks being considered? What about additional powers for the Garda? What are the plans for the 14-day period of isolation? Is the Minister working with colleagues in the North to ensure that these protocols apply to all ports and airports on the island of Ireland?

I want to raise the issue of traffic guarantees and how they might be affected at this time during the Covid-19 crisis. Has the Minister any information about the liability that the taxpayer is now coming under as a result of traffic guarantees on public private partnership projects, given the fact that traffic volumes have nose dived? What are taxpayers' liabilities for March and April, for example? Have the Minister or his Department investigated whether there is a

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-20 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Children and Youth Affairs): Statements	1	Covid-19 public health advice is deliberately intended to restrict the movement of people and to get them to stay at home or as close to home as possible. While this public health advice has a significant impact on us all, it has a very profound impact on children at risk. I refer to children who live in homes that are not safe havens or sanctuaries; unfortunately for some children, home is the exact opposite.  People working in this area say that we have a perfect storm. We have children forced back into abusive homes but without the usual, normal protections provided by the mandated people who help to keep them safe and out of harm's way, like teachers, for example, who would otherwise spot something untoward. They also say that offenders are more active online now and are acting with more freedom. On the one hand, opportunities to abuse are greatly increased while, on the other hand, opportunities to intervene and help are reduced. I am sure we are all concerned about this matter and I ask the Minister to provide an update to the House on it. What has been the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on children at risk and on our ability to identify, protect and support them? One indicator might be referrals to Tusla, for example. Have these increased during this period, as one might expect in the circumstances, due to increases in cases of abuse or have they decreased, as one might fear, due to reduced reporting? I ask the Minister to provide an assessment and to outline her plans to respond and intervene. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	1	I will take seven minutes and Deputies Quinlivan and Wynne will take four minutes each. I welcome the announcement of the establishment of a task force for aviation recovery. It is very much needed and I ask that it be established and get through its work as quickly as possible. I recommend and encourage the Minister to include the unions representing workers, including Fórsa, SIPTU and IALPA, in the stakeholder forum. It is important that they are represented.  I acknowledge that in the Minister's opening statement he stated he is concerned that the industry has no certainty about when business might grow again. This is a significant destabilising influence in and of itself. I point out to the Minister that the aviation industry, citizens and customers of the industry look to him, as the Minister, and the Government for direction on this.  At the Covid-19 committee yesterday the Secretary General of the Department of Health said NPHET advised the Government on 3 April that the passenger locator form and 14-day period of self-isolation should be mandatory. The Government ignored that advice. More than three weeks later, on 26 April, the passenger locator form was introduced but it was voluntary and not very well adhered to, as we know. Only on 28 May, a further five weeks later, was the form made mandatory.  On what basis did the Government ignore the NPHET advice on 3 April only to be half implemented on 28 May, a full eight weeks later?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	2	It was stated at the committee yesterday that the advice from NPHET was not adhered to or was not taken on board at that time anyway.  We were also told yesterday the Minister for Health is currently examining the possibility of a mandatory 14-day period of self-isolation. This is causing considerable confusion. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport referred to the industry as well as travellers, including would-be holiday makers, looking to the summer and beyond. For how long will the 14-day self-isolation period be in place? If someone has a family holiday booked in mid-July, will they be expected to self-isolate for 14 days? Can the Minister give us a month, a week, or a date when this restriction will be lifted?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	3	Is the Minister indicating that we will move to a stage when the 14-day period of self-isolation will be mandatory? Is that something the Government is planning to implement?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	4	Okay. I thank the Minister.  One of the public criticisms of the 14-day period of self-isolation is that somebody can come out of the airport and hop onto a bus to their final destination with the possible transmission of infection. It is exacerbated by the lack of face coverings on public transport. Anybody using public transport will be aware of that. Yesterday at the Covid-19 committee meeting, I asked Anne Graham of the NTA if she would insist on face coverings becoming mandatory for all passengers and drivers on public transport. She said it was not her decision, but it was a decision for the Minister and for Government. I ask the Minister the same question. Will he insist and when will he insist on face coverings being mandatory on public transport for drivers and passengers?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-10 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Wynne and Ó Broin.  I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue. Transport will be central to our moving towards a low-carbon economy. Over the past 30 years, the transport sector showed the greatest overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions at 137%, with road transport increasing by 143%. In 2018, transport was responsible for 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. Those figures give a sense of the challenge. They are also, in large part, an indictment of the failure of successive Governments to address this challenge properly. It is clear that we cannot afford to continue down the path of emissions increasing year on year. We must take people out of cars by providing alternatives that make sense. The Minister's annual transition document highlights this on page 33, which states that the provision of meaningful alternatives to the private car is central to decarbonising the transport sector. This is true, but it does not mirror the actions of this Government. We must invest in public and active transport.  We have a problem with car dependency across the board. It is compounded by uneven regional development. People who live on the east coast, in Dublin and in the commuter belt areas are acutely aware of the increase in road transport. People in my constituency of Meath East most certainly are. This is due to chronic underfunding of public transport, resulting in it being undesirable. It takes too long. One is sitting in traffic at Blanchardstown, The Halfway House or Glasnevin and it costs too much. We need high speed, high volume bus routes running on quality bus corridors.  We must also invest in rail. Despite being ideally located next to the capital, County Meath does not have a rail line serving the vast majority of the county. Navan is the highest populated town in Ireland that is not served by train. Large urban centres such as Ashbourne, Ratoath and Dunshaughlin would benefit greatly from such a service, as would towns such as Kells and Trim. Without it, thousands of commuters are forced to spend hours in traffic getting to and from work. They prefer the car because it is more bearable. Sinn Féin has consistently highlighted the urgent need for a rail line from Dublin to Navan, which would take thousands of cars off the road each day and bring massive benefits to commuters who could spend less time in traffic and more time with family and friends. Will the Minister give an update on the Navan rail line and its potential to contribute to a low-carbon economy? When will the review of this project be completed and when will the project be funded? This must be part of an ambitious and transformative plan for public transport that serves to reorientate the transport system on the island of Ireland.  We must improve electric car infrastructure and supports. We need to have more people out of cars but we also must recognise that for many people a car will remain a necessity. This is particularly true in rural Ireland, but is not unique to it. Electric cars remain prohibitively expensive for most and the necessary infrastructure such as fast charging points is simply not in place. Has the Government any plans to make electric cars a more affordable and realistic option for people?  On the issue of rural transport, large areas of my constituency currently rely on the Local Link transport scheme. It is known as Flexibus in counties Meath, Louth and Fingal. Flexibus provides a great bus service to people in rural areas who live off the main transport routes, young people who have no access to public transport and people with disabilities who need accessible transport. It is a vital service that provides connectivity for large parts of rural Meath and for some of our most vulnerable citizens, the old, the sick, and people with disabilities. Unfortunately, despite increasing demand and huge unmet need, its budget has remained static. It is now faced with a funding shortfall which is putting services in jeopardy. Meath Deputies met the NTA on this issue last Friday. Will the Minister engage with the authority on this to ensure funding is made available to secure the future of this environmentally friendly public transport option?  On the issue of private bus operators and taking people out of their cars, the Minister will be aware of the challenges now facing private bus operators who also provide crucial transport connectivity for citizens, including many school transport services. Many of those bus operators have been left to fend for themselves with the Government gambling on whether they can make it through the current crisis. If these services are not protected, it will leave a significant gap in our transport services, forcing people into cars. This is another example of how Government policy states one aim but actually does the opposite. Will the Minister intervene personally on the issue of private bus operators to ensure we have a healthy bus and coach sector post Covid?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-14 14:00:00+01:00	Maternity Leave Benefit Extension: Motion [Private Members]	1	It takes a village to raise a child. Covid-19 and the restrictions that came with it put that fact up in lights. In the very short time I have, I will focus on first-time parents. I am familiar with the experience myself. People leave the hospital full of enthusiasm and love and bursting with pride but, in truth, they do not know what they are at and are half petrified. To overcome this, they lean on their family, friends, neighbours and anyone else who is willing to help. In normal times, there are many such people.  My good friends, whom the Minister knows, Micheál Óg Ó Gallachóir and Emma Dillon Gallagher, became parents for the first time on 14 March when Emma gave birth to beautiful baby Faolán. The picture of the first time baby Faolán met his grandad, seven days later, was posted on Twitter. It was retweeted 106,000 times and received 714,000 likes. It was seen all over the world. The new parents were asked to do media interviews in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. We could ask why that was the case. Many people will have seen it in the media. It is because in the photo Faolán is not in his grandad's arms - he cannot be - and his granddad is outside the house, peering in through the kitchen window at his grandson in his son's arms. Three generations are separated by a window due to Covid-19 restrictions. There was novelty in the story of the photo, but actually it was very sad. New mums and babies such as Emma and Faolán have been denied some of the very basic and essential supports that would otherwise be available. Routine check-ups, visits from the public health nurse, vaccinations, therapies, mother and baby groups, and breastfeeding circles have similarly been cancelled or postponed.  Postnatal depression has apparently increased threefold during the Covid period and I have no doubt the same applies to anxiety. Childcare is a significant issue and it needs to be addressed. It takes a village to raise a child. Covid-19 has denied mothers and babies that benefit. It has been said to me that we were forced to close the doors and lock ourselves away for three months. The only compassionate and decent thing to do for new mothers and babies is to support the Sinn Féin motion. I support Deputy Carthy's proposal that the Government withdraw its amendment as it does not go anywhere near far enough. I commend the Sinn Féin motion to the House.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:30:00+01:00	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	1	I support the comments of previous speakers. The commitment to public transport is fundamental to the programme for Government and private operators play a key role in scheduled services, tourism, tours and school transport. It is an important issue. These providers are honest, decent, hard workers and they deserve the full support of the State.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:30:00+01:00	Future of School Education: Motion [Private Members]	1	I have good reason to focus my time on classroom sizes in Meath, as we have the highest in Ireland in Ashbourne, or on school buildings. Lismullen national school, for example, is one of the oldest and in the most urgent need of address. However, I wish to focus my comments on access. The future of education has to be one of public and active transport. That must the way of the future as it makes sense with or without Covid-19. We must get children walking or cycling or on the bus and out of cars. That said, there are areas that urgently need to be addressed. Many schools have no footpath access to the front door. One in five reported this to be the case in a recent Green-Schools survey.  It is clear that we must support and expand our school transport system. I urge the Minister to meet representatives of the school bus transport sector. They were out in droves protesting today. They have been treated very badly during the pandemic. Many were left without any State supports and they are on their knees. The Government's back-to-school roadmap did not contain enough detail for them. The operators I spoke to today still have a range of questions. They want to know what obligations will be placed on them with regard to loading and unloading buses. For example, will it be left to them to police the proposed compulsory seating arrangements? In terms of the funding announced, there is very little detail about how the €11 million will be allocated. Time is precious as we only have four weeks.  It is clear that a comprehensive, long-term strategy for school transport is long overdue. The service has been eroded over the years. I refer to what is happening with concessionary passes, for example. The service has been hollowed out and this must stop. We must address it and a step change is needed now.

We have all received correspondence from airline pilots, particularly in regard to Aer Lingus, our national carrier. There is a real conflict between the interests of the aviation industry and the interest of public health. It is important for the State to step in to support our national carrier. Some aviation workers feel vulnerable regarding the future prospects of the sector and their own jobs. It is a major employer and of considerable strategic importance. Those workers need every support. The future of the aviation industry cannot be built on targeting people who have flights booked but who are not in a position to travel while heeding public health advice. I ask the Taoiseach to step in on behalf of the workers.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-08 14:00:00+01:00	Cancer Screening: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I commend Deputy Cullinane on tabling the motion. It is timely and important. The CervicalCheck scandal and now Covid-19 with the suspension of screening programmes have brought cancer care in Ireland into focus again. I am sure others will address the important issues of delayed and missed diagnoses and the unnecessary pain and hurt this causes. Others will mention the poor outcomes we experience in Ireland. Five year survival rates for ovarian, colon and rectal cancers lag considerably behind other wealthy western countries.  I want to focus my comments on the essential role of medical scientists in cancer care, screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. As it applies to Covid-19 testing, a headline in a national newspaper two days ago read, ""Overworked medical scientists warn of burnout as testing requirements increase."" The same could be said at any stage in recent years of the general services that medical scientists are expected to perform, many of which relate to delivery of cancer care. This is a proud profession that feels underappreciated and undervalued. I know this myself because I worked as a medical scientist for a number of years, starting in 2003. The representative bodies - the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine and the profession's union, the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association - have, in my experience, stated their concerns loudly over two decades. We should be very proud of this profession, and I am sure the Minister is. We produce fantastic graduates, the best in Europe. There is a competition every year and we win it consistently. All those in the profession are educated to degree level, most have master's degrees, many have multiple master's degrees and many have PhDs. Increasingly, they are taking on FRCPath and MRCPath. We do not train enough medical scientists. Of those we train, 25% emigrate or go into industry. Those who stay to work in the Irish public health system are frustrated by the lack of recognition or of career progression opportunities. They have lived with pay inequality for decades, and that needs to be addressed.  The Minister and I have spoken privately about this before. I know he is interested in the opportunity there is available. I believe there is a clear win for the Government in this. I ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to take the opportunity to meet representatives of medical scientists. They have a great opportunity to contribute significantly more than they are being asked to contribute. I think there is a win there for the Government and I would appreciate it if the Minister took up that proposal."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-10 10:30:00+01:00	Services for People with Disabilities: Statements	1	I will continue in the same vein as the previous speaker by talking about the need to ensure that transport services are in place. St. Ultan's special school, Navan is served by 22 buses, all of which are close to capacity. Twenty of those buses carry students for St. Ultan's and other schools, including St. Mary's special school. Issues in that regard need to be acknowledged and addressed as quickly as possible. I have been contacted by numerous parents who have expressed their genuine and earnestly-felt concerns. They need to be addressed.  The issues extend beyond that and I encourage the Minister for State to contact her colleagues in education and transport about the constraints on school bus transport. Some 120,000 children were carried on buses last year, including 14,000 with special educational needs. Only 97,000 places have been allocated this year, a reduction of 23,000. That urgently needs to be tackled. My colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, in conjunction with me and Deputy Conway-Walsh, has submitted proposals for tackling that matter. This obviously has clear implications for mainstream and special schools, children with additional needs, and people who are attending day services. It also has implications for the broader transport network. I have been contacted by numerous people who are delighted that services are beginning to open up again albeit that service is patchy and partial. The lack of transport services is a significant block. We must get back to a place where those services are provided again.  I thank the Minister of State for meeting a constituent of mine, Ms Laura Campion, who has been advocating on behalf of her sister. As we have heard from other Deputies, the Minister of State is engaging with groups but we want to see as much progress as possible. Particular concerns have been raised about contingency planning. Nobody wants to go back to lockdown so let us see the plan to continue opening up services and providing respite for families. It is not an issue about day services but it has been reported that some people have experienced significant difficulty in accessing respite, which is of concern.  I will speak about access to day services for adults who live in a residential setting with my remaining few seconds. Service providers have stated that service users in residential respite will be unable to attend their day service under current HSE advice. That is of considerable concern and the gap needs to be addressed.  I wish the Minister of State well in her efforts to tackle those problems.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-17 10:30:00+01:00	Climate Action: Statements	1	I welcome the Minister back to the House. I shared a similar experience to his in recent weeks. It is part of living with Covid. It gives us a clear understanding of the importance of a testing and tracing system that is responsive and rapid. Personal behaviour and a sound healthcare system are the foundation on which our future will be built.  I welcome the inclusion of statements on climate action in the schedule. It is important we keep the topic at the top of the Dáil's agenda although statements on their own will not be enough, and the Minister is aware of this. We need tangible changes that will alter our current path. I look forward to the Minister bringing forward the climate action Bill soon and working with the Government to ensure it is ambitious and fair. The Minister might provide us with an update on its progress.  The challenge of climate change is undeniable despite what some might say. The science is clear and the evidence is powerful and alarming, whether it be in California at present, Siberia in recent months, the Arctic Circle or Australia. I have a brother in Australia with whom I speak weekly. When he speaks about bad weather it is not like the bad weather here. What he means is that it is so warm people cannot go outside or the forest fires are so close that the children cannot go to playschool. We have had our own experience in Ireland in a clearer way in more recent times. Through Met Éireann's detailed and reliable climate data, which has been collected since the mid-1800s, we can see Ireland's average annual temperature has increased by 1°C over the past 100 years. I commend the work of Met Éireann and the work of geographers throughout the country, including at the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit. The Minister's colleague at the Department of Education and Skills is still intent on downgrading geography as a subject at junior certificate level and this is a regressive move for the climate effort.  Our climate has changed and is continuing to do so. We are now seeing more damaging storms and more destructive floods as a result. The evidence is clear to everyone. We have seen examples of this across the island such as the partial collapse of Dunbeg Fort in Dingle in 2018, the impact of coastal and inland erosion on the Spanish Armada wrecks off the Sligo coast and the collapse of Rathcannon Castle during Storm Ophelia. There are many other examples such as the extreme and concerning coastal erosion at Portrane, County Dublin.  It will not be enough to continue simply building flood barriers and hope for the best. Man-made protections are no match for the power of climate change events. Without significant change, this will be the new reality for billions of people across the globe for years to come. It will take a global effort to alter this trajectory. I believe Ireland can become a world leader in eliminating reliance on fossil fuels and changing our habits to greener alternatives. If it makes sense for people to do it and if it is done in a fair and equitable way, then there should be no issue.  For this to happen, however, the Government's approach must be one of bringing people along on the journey with it. Taxing people who have no alternatives or carbon shaming people simply will not work. The Government's proposed increase in carbon tax is exactly the wrong approach. This October the Government will increase the cost for people to heat their homes and drive to work with far more significant impact on income inequality and deprivation indices than on carbon emissions. Most people would love an insulated home and solar panels on their roof. Many would love an electric car or the option of no car at all. This is a million miles away, however, from most people's current household budgets. In fact, it is beyond the capabilities of the infrastructure and public services which the State provides, particularly public transport services, due to government underinvestment for years. Taxing people more this October and for the next ten budgets will not change this. In fact, it will make the issue worse.  Affordable alternatives need to be in place before a behavioural tax can work. In the meantime, it is not a behavioural tax but a punitive one. Not only does it hammer those who can least afford it, it leaves a sour taste in people's mouths about climate action. They feel they are being punished for something totally out of their control. It is the exact opposite to bringing people along on the journey that we are supposed to be on together.  There is the targeting of items such as two-for-one dinners included in the recently launched waste action plan. The action plan commits to working with retailers to end the sale of multibuy packs. There was a significant and understandable angry public response to this for two reasons. First, many people depend on these special offers to feed their families. When one looks at the cost of rent, insurance and childcare and other living costs, this is a reality for many families. Second, people thought of the many other actions that could be taken to target the environmental sphere. Two-for-one dinners are not the highest priority. There was a particular media presentation but it was dreadful.  The same applies for penalising people for buying more affordable clothes. It is insulting and offensive to people who are struggling to make ends meet. It reeks of that idea of going for quality over quantity and telling people to stop being poor. It reminds me of Terry Pratchett's boot tax where those wealthy enough can afford good boots which last longer and they save money in the long run while those who are poor go through many more boots at more expense.  We have to understand the position which people find themselves and the way they engage with the environment, the climate and the economy. We have to meet them where they are. These proposals infuriated people not because they do not want to tackle waste in the fashion industry but because it is yet another tax on the consumer rather than tackling the root causes behind it. Solutions to our waste and environmental challenges cannot just always be a levy or a tax on consumers. This has always been the go-to and simple idea by successive Governments. It does more harm than good to people's attitudes to green politics.  On energy policy, I have spoken privately to the Minister on the North-South interconnector. My honest and heartfelt opinion is that it will not proceed as currently proposed. Planning permission, North and South, is not available due to the level of public opposition. Will the Government engage with communities to find a way forward? There is a way forward but it will only be found with genuine engagement. I would like to know the Minister's plans in this regard.  Transitioning from a reliance on fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy will play a key role in our national climate action effort. Recent industry reports have indicated there are significant challenges in that regard which the Minister acknowledged. What measures will the Government take to address them?  The level of community engagement in the RESS, renewable electricity support scheme, is a real positive. Is enough being done, however, to maximise the potential to look at new economies and new models of delivering energy? I do not believe there is. I am happy to work with the Minister as Opposition spokesperson to advance the opportunities for community-generated energy, as well as for communities to be able to plug in and contribute to the grid.  I live in County Meath where we want people to use public transport. For that to happen, public transport needs to work for people. We need an improved bus network and the Navan rail line to be opened. We have discussed this on numerous occasions and we will continue to do so. I hope it can be progressed. Sinn Féin has committed to playing a constructive role in opposition. We understand and accept the need for system change and to work towards a zero-emissions economy. We are clear in our position, however, that it must be done with, not to, communities. Fundamental to that is the principle of climate justice and a just transition.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-22 13:30:00+01:00	Community Safety and Fireworks: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy Ward for bringing this motion forward. It is timely and important, particularly for the people living in the areas most affected. It is fair to say that these issues present in different ways in different places, some at the more extreme end. The solution is the same in all cases and it is clearly outlined in the Sinn Féin motion. It is about ensuring there are sufficient Garda numbers for prevention and deterrence and adequate community resources, both physical and human.  I am a Deputy for Meath East, as is the Minister. Our county has the lowest number of gardaí per head of population in the State. One of our new towns, Ratoath, is the largest town in Ireland without a Garda station. We have the youngest small towns in the State in Stamullen, Enfield and Longwood and the youngest large towns in Navan and Ashbourne, according to census data. These towns have it in common that they have grown rapidly in the past two decades and have been victims of the Celtic tiger. It has been all about houses and more houses. County Meath has the lowest number of playgrounds, public green spaces, community centres and youth facilities. In the case of the latter, if one does not play GAA or soccer, they are non-existent. There are residents in one particular area in Ashbourne who have spent years trying to protect the last remaining patch of green space for their children to play. They have presented their case to Meath County Council and An Bord Pleanála time and again only to have the rug pulled from under them in the past week. In trying to provide a decent environment for their families to live, they are doing the State's work. Instead of being supported, they are being impeded at every hand's turn.  In ten years' time, when the same issues are being debated again in this House, the Deputies representing County Meath will, if they are honest, be saying that things have got worse. We will all know why that is the case. I am contacted on a regular basis by residents in Kells, Stamullen, Ashbourne and Ratoath, among other places, about nuisance and antisocial behaviour. The Minister knows well that such activity is regular and to an extent that warrants address. Some people are being terrorised in their own homes. We see the evidence of it on every community Facebook page and it must be stopped. I urge the Minister and all other Deputies to support the Sinn Féin motion. The Minister must increase the Garda presence for prevention and deterrence and increase community infrastructure, both physical and human. That is what is needed.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	1	I am sharing with Deputies Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Maurice Quinlivan; they may or may not arrive. I will have an opportunity during Question Time tomorrow to raise the taxi industry, public and school bus transport and other important issues relating to transport with the Ministers. I will be glad to have the opportunity to do that. I want to focus today on the aviation industry. I echo the Minister's commendation of front-line transport workers during the Covid period. Although the aviation sector was one of the worst affected sectors, few specific proposals have been introduced to mitigate the damage caused by the pandemic in this area. The report, Focus on Aerospace & Aviation, prepared by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and published last month, highlights the value of the aviation sector to the State and outlines the huge challenges now posed as a result of Covid-19. Some 140,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector here, but many are now in jeopardy due to the ongoing pandemic. The staff range from airport staff and cabin crew to mechanics and aircraft leasing employees. The industry is worth €8.9 billion to our economy. As an island nation, we depend on quality air connectivity more than most for business and tourism.  Page 8 of the report states:  Unaided, many airlines could go out of business before travel restrictions are lifted. Some governments have already provided loans or taken temporary equity stakes in airlines and airports to moderate disruption, for example in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the US. On this point, what plans, if any, are afoot here to provide State support to airlines in the form in question? I am aware of the supports the Minister outlined in more general terms. The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme remain in place.  Workers at Aer Lingus fear for the future of their jobs, given the crisis facing the aviation sector, which will stretch right into 2021 and beyond. If the treatment of these staff, in terms of the refusal to sign benefit entitlement forms, is anything to go by, these fears are well justified. That issue is not resolved. There is some movement on the employment wage subsidy scheme but the temporary wage subsidy scheme and back pay still need to be addressed. Could the Minister, in his closing comments, state whether he has made contact with the company or his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys? When will this issue be resolved? When will staff get their back pay?  On the company more generally, has the Government discussed a proposal on cash for equity in Aer Lingus to shore it up, protect jobs and guard against the loss of important routes? Similar moves are happening internationally and are being permitted under the relaxed EU state aid rules that have obtained during the pandemic. Earlier this year, the German state took a 20% stake in Lufthansa in exchange for a €9 billion rescue package. At the beginning of this month, the European Commission approved a €200 million bailout for Alitalia, with the Italian Government now retaking control of the airline. It is important that the Irish State try to protect as many jobs and routes as possible to ensure connectivity for the travel, business and inward tourism that we will depend on for our recovery.  It was a terrible decision to sell the State's remaining shares in Aer Lingus in 2015, and one Sinn Féin opposed. Fine Gael and the Labour Party ignored the very legitimate concerns raised at the time, and we are now living with the cost. A sum of €335 million was raised from the sale. The proceeds were used to set up a fund called the connectivity fund, managed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. According to information I have recently received from the Minister for Finance, only €90 million of this has been invested to date, leaving a pot of €245 million unspent. Has the Minister examined using the money sitting idle in the connectivity fund to shore up jobs in the aviation sector, including through retaking a stake in Aer Lingus and providing financial assistance to our regional airports, such as Cork and Shannon, which are facing massive challenges?  Our regional airports are facing their biggest challenge due to Covid, with only a couple of flights in and out each day. Management at Cork Airport has said the Covid-19 crisis has had a catastrophic impact on the airport's finances, with passenger numbers having fallen by 95% during lockdown and not expected to recover to 2019 levels for another four years. The airport said it will lose around €20 million this year as a result of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus and Ryanair have threatened to close operations at Shannon Airport, which would be a serious blow for the entire mid-west and fly in the face of the objective of balanced regional development.  Is the Minister planning to provide financial assistance in the upcoming budget to airports affected by the pandemic? I am not for a second suggesting we automatically dance to the tune of the multimillionaires who run Ryanair and Aer Lingus but we have to recognise that when we come out the other side of this, we will need an aviation sector that is intact and strong.  Airlines will cite the Government's approach to international travel as one of the factors contributing to some of their current difficulties. Six months into the pandemic, it is shameful that we still have no testing capabilities in our airports, nor even the most basic temperature screening of arriving passengers. People fill in a form and they are literally on their way. One will not find a less restrictive process anywhere else in the world these days. We now have seven countries on the green list. As of an hour ago, with Germany having been added to the list, six of the seven countries have restrictions on Irish people travelling thereto. Most of them have some sort of testing regime. If other countries around the world have introduced testing and temperature screening at their airports, why has the Irish Government decided to take a different approach? At the Covid committee this morning, we heard about the opportunity that exists regarding testing. I will not elaborate on that but will let my colleagues contribute.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-24 10:30:00+01:00	EU-UK Negotiations on Brexit: Statements	1	I would like to raise the issue of connectivity. Yesterday, I raised the aviation sector with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. There are very particular challenges there, as the Minister will be well aware. This morning, we heard from Mr. Eugene Drennan, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, and Mr. John Martin, the policy manager for haulage association in the North. They share the same concerns, albeit from geographically different perspectives. They stated that trade will be severely upset because of Brexit and the price of some goods could double. They stated the impact will be significant and that they have been warning about it for two years. Systems that were promised and planned are not in place either here or in Britain. On the British side, customs agents have not been recruited and the goods vehicle management system, GVMS, and Smart Freight IT system are not in place. There is a threat - it is to be hoped that is all it is - that there could be queues of up to 7,000 vehicles at ports in Britain. Our own systems are not up and running. There is no contingency planning. There are approximately 800,000 to 1 million movements of units annually between Ireland and Britain alone. It is a massive challenge.  I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister about the strategic importance of connectivity for us as an island nation. This morning, the two spokespersons to whom I referred addressed the issues of surety of service, timelines, just-in-time delivery and the whole logistics operation on which so much of our economy and livelihoods depend. They spoke of the need for an alternative route bypassing Britain and going straight to the Continent. What I wish to emphasise is that we have only a few months to prepare and, as the saying goes, failing to prepare is preparing to fail. The window of opportunity is very limited. Every effort must be made to put the required systems in place. I refer to the three-step system that has been promised on this side because the obvious consequences on 1 January and thereafter are spectacular and need to be avoided at all costs.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-15 10:30:00+01:00	Financial Resolution No. 7 - General: Motion (Resumed)	1	I welcome some of the positive announcements in the budget in the areas of climate action and transport. Investing in our public transport system, active travel options and improving the quality of our roads and rail lines are all vitally important in addressing our emissions obligations and improving the quality of life of our citizens. Unsurprisingly, I also want to address a number of the areas where we believe the Government has failed and set out why we believe these issues should be approached differently.  Sinn Féin's position on a carbon tax is well known. It is not that we do not want to address the use of fossil fuels in our homes and cars, but we believe targeting people with a punitive tax is not a fair or just approach and it will not actually help. In fact, it will do the opposite. The carbon tax applies to all the things people cannot do without, such as petrol to get them to work, gas to cook their dinner and home heating oil to keep them warm.  The 29% increase announced is inherently unfair as the richer a person is, the easier this tax is to avoid. Those who have the money can buy electric cars, install a fleet of solar panels on their roofs and retrofit their homes, thereby avoiding the tax increase in all of these areas. Most people simply cannot do this. Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said the carbon tax will help people to choose the right thing. The Labour Party said the carbon tax is the litmus test of our commitment to our climate obligations. That reflects the starting position for individuals. I was genuinely astonished by those statements.  Many people would love to choose an electric car and have their homes retrofitted so their heating bills would not be sky high. They would love to choose to have solar panels on their roofs or take a train or a dependable bus instead of sitting for hours in traffic. Most people do not have a spare €50,000 to buy a larger vehicle or retrofit their home and get a heat pump. By pushing up their bills through a carbon tax, they will have less money tomorrow to do all these things. The Government is punishing people for not being able to afford the cost of upgrading to greener alternatives. That is a punitive and brutal approach that will hamper our transition to a low carbon society and will really hurt people in the process. The people who are being targeted are the most vulnerable and will bear the most significant burden.  The carbon tax increase is already going to impact some of the industries already on the floor due to Covid-19. Taxi drivers and bus operators are going to be hit with significant additional fuel costs all while their businesses have been decimated. Again, these industries want to transition to cleaner and greener alternatives but affordable, realistic alternatives are simply not there yet. Punishing them with higher bills now will make their precarious financial situation worse and will not actually help the environment. As my time is limited I will conclude on that point.  I look forward to the Government and the Ministers publishing more details on their budget proposals, particularly in the area of retrofitting which was light on detail. We know that there are very significant delays and waiting lists and the figures in the budget need significantly more scrutiny which I look forward to giving.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-21 10:00:00+01:00	Post Office Network: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank the Regional Group for tabling this important motion. Sinn Féin is happy to support it. We have submitted an amendment which we believe further adds to the motion and we hope that people can support it. The work of postmasters and workers throughout our postal service has been vital during this pandemic, ensuring that people can stay in contact, access their weekly payments and pay their bills. I commend An Post's recent initiative of providing free post to our friends and family who are resident in nursing homes. It is a fantastic idea and commendable, and I hope people make good use of it.  Sinn Féin has always been vocal in its support for protecting the post office network. Post offices are crucial services in our towns and villages and are especially important in rural Ireland where they provide essential services and serve as a meeting point in local communities. Despite the invaluable role that our post offices play, the network has regrettably suffered from years of neglect by successive Governments, with hundreds of closures and the loss of vital outlets throughout rural Ireland. These include post offices in my constituency of Meath East which were closed in 2018, including my local post office in Tara, and at Bellewstown and Clonalvy. I remember them as a county councillor at the time and there are other examples. Post office closures have had a severe impact on individual villages and communities. Local shops subsequently closed.  At that time, Sinn Féin tabled a motion on the future of our post office network. Some 159 post offices were earmarked for closure, including seven in Meath. There was little more than rhetoric from the then Government. Nothing was done to secure the future of the network. We asked that the proposals contained in the 2016 Kerr report, which included post offices providing alternative services such as financial services and Government services, be implemented immediately. We also suggested that a new model of community banking be established through the post office network to fill the void left by commercial banks in rural Ireland. Two years later, we are in much the same place, with even more challenges facing our post office network and little interest from Government in dealing with it.  Last month, the Irish Postmasters Union commissioned a report which sets out the significant challenges faced by post offices across the State and highlights the significant value and contribution they make to our economy and society. One of the central recommendations in this report is that a public service obligation be introduced to secure the future of the network and allow post offices to continue to provide their excellent and important services. Some €17 million per annum was suggested for this annual public service obligation. When Sinn Féin tabled its motion on the future of post offices in September 2018, Fianna Fáil tabled an amendment calling for just such a public service obligation to be introduced. With Fianna Fáil now the lead party in government, will it follow through on this commitment, which can secure the post office network, or is this just another broken promise? I note there is no such commitment in the Government's amendment this morning. We have included it in our amendment and, on that basis, we ask Fianna Fáil and its colleagues in government to withdraw its amendment and support the Regional Group's motion and the Sinn Féin amendment.  Another proposal that we have included seeks the expansion of the role of post offices as a one-stop shop for those inquiring about and applying for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland grants or other similar green initiatives. These will be crucial in future. There is a welcome and much-needed commitment from Government to expand these services, which we appreciate, but many may not be able to access these grants through online portals. Our post offices should become a place where people can access information about these grants, talk to a person about them, be encouraged and persuaded if needs be, and get help in applying for them. This can help to increase the uptake of these grants and also provide our post offices with a new avenue of business. We are having a conversation at the Joint Committee on Climate Action about public involvement in addressing climate change and our obligations. I believe that post offices can play a key role in outreach and engagement. It is a win-win for our post offices and environment, and I ask the Minister to consider further expansion of this emerging role for post offices.  We need creativity from the Government. We cannot have business as usual. We cannot come back next year with another debate on the same challenges. Post offices are critical State infrastructure throughout our island and need proper investment, ambition and attention from this Government.

I thank her for that. She outlined the nature of the time pressure due to legislative changes at EU level so Sinn Féin is happy to support the legislation. I will keep my comments brief given the requirement to deal with all Stages this week to ensure the legislation can be put in place by 31 October.  Railways are an incredibly important part of our transport infrastructure serving workers, tourists and businesses across the State. The neglect of our railways by successive Governments in the 20th century set us back decades and it is a price many people continue to pay today. Some 81% of people who leave my county of Meath daily to go to work do so by car because the rail infrastructure was allowed to crumble and disappear in the past 60 or 70 years. It is a terrible shame which is replicated in many other areas, most evidently in the north west where there is a total absence of rail connection.  I spoke to the Minister of State previously about the need to invest in our railways to make up for lost time and contribute to our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. There is a compelling case to be made for passenger and freight rail.  The work of the RAIU is to investigate when things go wrong on the rail network. The purpose of an investigation carried out by the RAIU is to improve railway safety by establishing the cause of an accident with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future. In 2019, the RAIU completed 43 preliminary examination reports into a wide range of incidents on our railways. These included tram road traffic collisions, a trap and drag incident on the Luas, level crossing collisions, derailments, fires, cattle strikes, apparent self-harm occurrences and a near miss collision between a train and a rail worker. It is clear from those few examples that the work of the RAIU is very important and is central to establishing what has gone wrong in a particular situation to try to prevent its recurrence in the future.  It is vital that these powers of investigation are available for rail accidents including those on light rail and heritage railways. This Bill seeks to ensure that continues to be the case after 31 October taking account of changes at EU level and therefore we are happy to support the Bill and facilitate its expedient passage. The RAIU is a small operation that comprises very few individuals but the work they do is extremely important and often goes under the radar. We want to thank them for that work.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-21 10:00:00+01:00	Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	1	"I am conscious that the Chamber and the Houses of the Oireachtas have approached this legislation and this type of question numerous times in the past. Those most vulnerable and in need of support have often fared poorly.  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters was never meant to be an end in and of itself. Maybe there are those who hoped it would be. Maybe there are those who wished it never happened. There is no doubt that the commission in its terms of reference was far from complete or comprehensive. For example, in my county of Meath, the Good Shepherd Sisters Ard Mhuire home in Dunboyne was included in the work of the commission but the St. Joseph's and St. Clare's institution in Stamullen was not, despite the fact that we know it was a mother and baby home in every practical meaning of that term. Unmarried mothers were separated from their babies there. Babies died there. Some babies underwent vaccine trials there. Advocates estimate there were over 180 such institutions. Many survivors were excluded from the process.  In the conduct of its business the commission has refused survivors the opportunity to a public hearing. Then it made the case that there was little demand for such public hearings. In this way and in other ways the commission was not what it could be and not what it should have been. Despite that, it has done important work. It has compiled, collated, generated and gathered information. The sum total of its work will be made up of each component part and that is what it will leave. A report of 4,000 pages, or however many pages, based on the commission's distinct perspective and analysis, will not suffice and could never suffice.  In the first instance, the archive and records must be available to survivors. This is their wish and it must be respected. The records must stay intact and must not be sealed. They must not go to Tusla. The Minister has the power to make that happen. He can amend the 2004 legislation if needed, although I am unsure whether that is needed. He can retrospectively prescribe if needed - he is already doing that. The Minister should take this opportunity to put right these wrongs and show survivors that Ireland has changed. We stand ready to support him if that is what he wants to do.  Several of my colleagues have used this opportunity to read the words of survivors into the record of the Dáil. With my last few seconds I will do the same. One survivor who spoke to the Clann project on the subject of coercion and forced adoptions said: ""In early February 1968, when my baby boy was six-seven weeks old, he was wrenched from my breast by one of the nuns whilst I was breastfeeding him and taken away for adoption."" She made clear that ""at no time did I give my consent to my son's adoption."" Another said she was not given any other options. A survivor I spoke to said she did nothing wrong and her baby did nothing wrong. They did nothing wrong but they were failed and now is the time to change that."

It is wrong to state that this is related to Covid and that there is no demand. There has never been more demand for school bus transport and never have more children been refused.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-11 10:00:00+00:00	Regional Airports: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy McNamara and the Independent Group for bringing forward this important motion. Sinn Féin is very happy to support the motion and has submitted an amendment to include the south east.  The aviation recovery task force report, published earlier this year, highlighted the huge value of aviation to the Irish economy. Air transport contributes an estimated €8.9 billion to our GDP and supports in the region of 140,000 jobs across the State.  I, like many of my colleagues, have been in contact with a huge number of constituents who work across this sector and who have been particularly affected by the pandemic and resulting restrictions. These workers range from pilots and cabin crew to airport workers, ground crew, travel agents and other workers who depend on the aviation industry. To a man and woman they have faced real difficulty this year, with little to no work and a huge drop in incomes, putting real pressure on their personal finances. They understand the impact the pandemic has had on international travel but their demand of the Government is fair and reasonable. They want the Government to do all it can to protect their jobs and prepare for the resumption of foreign travel when it is safe to do so.  I have consistently expressed my concern that the  We have heard from the airports' representatives at the transport committee that it takes years of work to secure routes and once they are lost, they are very difficult to get back. Our international airports are crucially important for attracting investment and tourism to the regions and are key to balanced regional development. We cannot allow important routes to Britain and the US especially to lapse during this pandemic.  I very much welcome the additional funding announced by the Minister yesterday for airports around the State, but this was only one aspect of the recommendations of the aviation recovery task force report and much more work is needed. Recommendation No. 3 of the task force report was for a comprehensive test, track and trace system and despite repeated calls we still do not have this. On track and trace, according to figures I have received, 82% of people who complete the passenger locator form do not get a follow-up call. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the requirement for arrivals to restrict movements for 14 days is not being followed in many cases and empirical evidence from the summer confirms this.  On testing, I have been asking both this and the previous Government to put a testing system in place since before the summer. I am glad the Government eventually conceded to this fundamental principle but it took far too long and the system is still not in place. The delay is inexplicable, as is the delay in conducting our own comparative analysis of Covid assay and testing technologies, such as looking at polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing versus loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, testing versus rapid antigen. That should have been done months ago. While we all hope a vaccine will be the key to defeating the virus, that is still just a hope and with the best will in the world it will take considerable time to be administered so a robust testing and tracing system will be needed well into 2021. If it is done right, it can help restart the aviation sector and help tens of thousands of people across the industry get back to work in a safe way. We should rigorously and proactively pursue the option of pre-departure testing with rapid testing technology.  I welcome this motion on the aviation sector and its essential strategic importance but I reiterate that the future of the aviation sector cannot be built on the back of exploiting loyal workers. Newspaper headlines stated that workers were struggling to afford to feed their children. They were hovering above the poverty line due to the way the TWSS and EWSS were implemented. I know that to be the case and it is shameful. Similarly, thousands of customers are still waiting for refunds and vouchers. Many more lost out altogether as ghost planes left without them but with their money. Travel agents were affected in the same way. This is absolutely disgraceful from airline companies and it has not gone unnoticed. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-11 10:00:00+00:00	Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	I have raised this issue with the Minister before. My contribution will focus on how Brexit will affect our road haulage sector and the impact it will have on those using the land bridge through Britain to transport goods onto and off this island. The Copenhagen Economics report commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation found that two thirds of Irish goods exporters or 150,000 heavy goods vehicles make use of the UK land bridge to access continental markets each year. It is a vital route but one that is under threat as a result of Brexit.  Whether it is a hard, soft or indifferent Brexit, new checks and procedures as a result of Britain leaving the European Union will mean significant delays and queues at the Dover-Calais crossing and there is the promise of significant delays at Holyhead and on the Irish side too. These delays will impact on the sector hugely and the Government must move decisively to mitigate this impending crisis for as many hauliers as possible. A report from the Irish Maritime Development Office published in the past few days states that there are currently sufficient shipping connections and capacity to accommodate hauliers who want to bypass Britain and sail directly to continental Europe in order to avoid the delays that will inevitably arise there in January. This, I have to say, came as a shock to many in the road haulage sector who were not consulted in the context of the report and who would dispute the Irish Maritime Development Office’s findings. It is a statement of fact that there is a clear deficit in current roll-on, roll-off services to Europe and gaps in the current shipping schedule to the Continent. We do not, for example, have daily sailings departing for the Continent every day. Exports, such as perishables for example, depend on just-in-time logistics and such gaps in departure times cannot be afforded.  Sinn Féin believes that the Government should prepare contingency plans for State-supported shipping routes, including public service obligation routes. These should be focused on roll-on, roll-off services where vehicles that currently use the land bridge have the option of using new, frequent and direct routes to the Continent that reduce the time at sea to the bare minimum. Leaving it solely up to private companies to put these essential shipping connections in place is an incredibly risky strategy, particularly given the critical importance of these routes for food imports and exports. When I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, she stated that it was up to individual haulage companies to contact ferry companies, essentially in order to stoke up demand. I have engaged with hauliers, very many of whom are from my constituency and my family has worked in haulage for many years. I have engaged with ferry companies as well. I welcome the fact that there is going to be a focus on this matter at the transport committee in the coming weeks but there is not enough focus on it yet from Government. We need to see that because time is of the essence.

I will also refer to Ireland's role on the European stage, and Europe's role on the global stage, in ensuring that, as a point of principle, nobody is denied free access to a vaccine based on location, financial means or any other discriminatory criterion. There have unfortunately been 1.4 million deaths as a result of Covid. There has been positive news on the development of vaccines by Pfizer, BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Janssen Pharmaceutica, also known as Johnson & Johnson, in addition to the Russian vaccine. It is worth noting that these vaccines have been developed through very different development processes. Public moneys have been at the very heart of the development of some. Some of this money has come through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, from which Moderna has received funding.  It is fair to say, however, that there have been significant levels of vaccine nationalism. Ireland is in quite a privileged position, as is Europe, but this is a global pandemic and we have a moral and ethical responsibility to lead from the front on that issue. In addition, from a very practical point of view, this is a global pandemic and we want to eradicate the virus globally. Therefore, in addition to our moral and ethical responsibility, it makes absolute sense to ensure that the vaccines are available to everyone who needs them. There are welcome developments at a European level including the COVAX facility and the new citizens' initiative, ""Right to Cure"". These are all motivated by the same intentions. In Ireland there are groups, including Access to Medicines Ireland, that have been campaigning on these issues for years. The global pandemic of Covid-19 has brought these issues into stark relief.   Yesterday, I attended the Oireachtas briefing on vaccine preparations by Professor Kingston Mills. The Government has a responsibility to do everything it can to ensure that supply lines and schemes are in place in Ireland.  I will make two points on the indemnity scheme. There is work to be done in that regard but those who take the vaccine are as entitled to the State's protection as the vaccine producers. It is very important work. The work that Professor Brian MacCraith and his group are doing needs to be supported in every way."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-03 09:00:00+00:00	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	1	The carbon tax is all stick. It is turning people against the environmental agenda, environmentalism and the effort to address climate change. It has no appreciation of the challenges in people's lives. Approximately 400,000 people in this State live in fuel and energy poverty. There are commitments in the budget and the Finance Bill concerning mitigation measures. They are only partial mitigation, however, and do not go anywhere near addressing the impact of the carbon tax in its totality, not this year and certainly not for the years to come.  The promised retrofitting schemes, the commitment to which I welcome, will not address the shortcomings or offset the impact of the carbon tax this year or into the future. There are waiting lists in the region of two and a half years. It should not be forgotten that some of these programmes are specifically targeted towards our most vulnerable, such as people living in poverty or with additional healthcare needs. The services and supports that are supposed to be in place - I accept Covid has had an impact - are not there for them or are not being delivered on time. Essentially, this is an additional tax with nothing to offset it in any real or meaningful way. The retrofitting schemes have to be bolstered. There needs to be a significant commitment in terms of the recruitment of people. There are workers ready and willing to do that retrofitting work. That needs to happen as quickly as possible.  On 1 December, the protections people had against utility disconnections were stopped. Last year, more than 5,000 people had their electricity disconnected and in excess of 2,400 people had their gas supply disconnected. There is no commitment or protection from the Government for those people today. However, we will introduce a carbon tax, essentially an additional levy for people who cannot afford to pay at this point in time. The public service obligation has been increased by 130%. Again, this is an additional burden on people whom the Minister intends to levy with a carbon tax as well. It simply makes no sense to people and they cannot afford it.  For those living in fuel and energy poverty, there was an emergency credit increase from €10 to €100. However, there was a levy on that. Instead of paying back the €100 recipients were grateful to get, they were forced to pay up to €170. People are penalised for living in poverty. That is the truth. That is what we get off Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and now the Green Party in government. The carbon tax is an insult to injury for those people, a point which the Government just does not realise.  On the just transition fund, those living at the coalface are the workers in Bord na Móna in the midlands and the energy sector. They have been moved out of that employment. They are living with promises from the Government about alternative pathways which have not materialised, again adding insult to injury.  The previous Government committed to a strategy to combat energy poverty but that has not materialised. It committed to an independently chaired energy poverty advisory group but this has not materialised. We are told by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that it will be reviewed next year. It is simply not good enough. It does not connect with the day-to-day experience of people and it is completely unacceptable from the Government.  With regard to the points made by previous speakers, it is one thing where there are alternatives for people but significant sectors of the population, particularly in rural areas, do not have alternatives available to them. This carbon tax is all stick. It adds insult to injury and in my firm opinion it does nothing to serve the environmental green agenda. In fact, it runs completely contrary to it. There is a firm commitment to introduce this for a number of years but there is no firm commitment on mitigation measures nor appreciation or understanding of the challenges people have, at a time when we are essentially forcing people back into their cars because Covid-19 means public transport is at 50% or 25%, depending on the level of Covid restrictions.  Along with the previous speaker, I support entirely the amendments tabled by Sinn Féin and others. I firmly believe the Government needs to realise the practical implications of the carbon tax as it is presented for ordinary people living their day-to-day lives when there are no alternatives for them. The Government has no intention or interest in providing those alternatives. This raises a serious question about what the carbon tax is about.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-09 10:00:00+00:00	Social Welfare Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	I thank my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, for tabling five important amendments to this Bill. Sinn Féin's amendments will help carers, those at risk of fuel poverty, jobseekers and workers, such as musicians and I hope the Government supports them.  I will raise a number of issues with the Minister. Workers in the aviation sector have faced a particularly significant challenge this year, with many on substantially reduced wages or having been let go altogether. I and other Sinn Féin representatives have repeatedly raised the case of Aer Lingus workers, who were being obstructed by their employer and the Minister's Department from accessing social welfare entitlements. This issue was eventually resolved for the EWSS but it has not been resolved for the TWSS. We are told by the Department that workers will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis but the truth is, on a case-by-case basis, these workers are crying foul. They are seeing a cut-and-paste response from the Department. For days in April, May and June when they were explicitly told by their employer they were on reduced days, their UP80 form is coming back all Os and no Xs. Unpaid leave is turning into something else. I call on the Minister in the strongest terms to intervene personally in this matter.  I turn to the matter of fuel and energy poverty. I welcome the increase of €3.50 per week in the fuel allowance. However, this is the Government giving with one hand and taking far more back with the other. The 14% increase in the fuel allowance is totally eclipsed by the 30% increase announced in the carbon tax and the 130% hike in the electricity public service obligation, PSO, levy. The punitive carbon tax will increase the price of a bag of coal or tank of oil for people as they try to heat their homes over winter. The enormous increase in the PSO levy will leave households with higher bills over the next 12 months.  Under section 25 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 2019, the Minister was required to commission an impact assessment on the current and projected future increases in carbon tax on low-income families. It found from various researches conducted that carbon tax increases will impact disproportionately on low-income households. That needs to be addressed and I encourage the Minister to do it in this Bill.

The ESRI reported earlier on this year in terms of lifetime community rating. Like so many aspects of this regime, perverse incentives persist. What happened on the back of the introduction of lifetime community rating was that younger people responded as intended by entering the market, and the insurance industry responded in kind and developed cheaper plans that give less cover. The practical effect of it was that younger people were paying less and getting less for their money, which resulted in significant out-of-pocket payments and a lack of solidarity. The intention of solidarity that was there did not materialise. Out-of-pocket payments remained very significant. On top of that, the indications are that premiums will increase next year by up to 7% and we still wait for the implementation of the de Buitléir report. The solution in all of this is a move away from public investment in private healthcare. There is significant public investment in private healthcare. We need to move to a single-tier public health service on the back of the Sláintecare report. Sinn Féin wants to see an all-island health service that is free at the point of delivery and delivered based on need rather than ability to pay. That is where we need to go.

It is timely and important. It is a motion about fairness and equality, about a decent day's pay for a decent day's work, but most of all it is about recognition and respect.  Student nurses will forgive me for using my time to speak on behalf of their front-line colleagues in the laboratory, medical scientists, because like student nurses, all nurses, public health doctors and so many across the health service, medical scientists are knocking at the Minister for Health's door and at the door of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, looking for recognition and respect. Medical scientists have performed heroics during Covid-19 and they have done it while delivering an uninterrupted routine and emergency service 24-7, 365 days a year. Despite this heroic effort, a headline in the media less than a week ago announced the threat of strike action from this group of workers. The chairperson of their union said the last thing any medical scientist wants is to be forced into this situation.  Laboratory services are hanging on by a thread. Medical scientists want recognition of their qualification, ability and contribution. I outlined this to the Minister before. All have degrees and many have masters degrees as standard. Others go further and do PhDs or take the fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, FRC, path, largely for their own personal development. The truth is that the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and their respective Ministers ensure a glass ceiling is imposed. Fifteen years into a 40-year career, they say a person can go no further. There is no opportunity for career progression and, as a result, significant potential goes untapped. While colleagues in Britain and elsewhere are taking on senior clinical and academic responsibilities up to and including consultant grade, medical scientists here are stymied. To add insult to injury, medical scientists have lived with the disrespect of pay inequality for decades. They work side by side doing the exact same work as clinical biochemists but are paid less. We wonder why we have a recruitment and retention crisis and the threat of strike action. There is a major opportunity here.  There is significant investment by the State in the public health service but we are not using it wisely. We have the equipment and the technology, but most of all we have the people, to be a world leader in medical and biomedical research and practice. We have scientists champing at the bit to take on advanced clinical roles, but the Government and departmental bureaucracy stops them in their tracks. I urge the Minister not to look this gift horse in the mouth and to grasp the opportunity, engage and address the needs of medical scientists.

This issue has come up time and again. We heard further reports at the weekend about the lack of follow-up on passenger locator forms, the information given when people were followed up on and the quality of the information coming back. It strikes me as a huge loophole and a gap in our ability to be confident that defences against Covid-19 are in place. Are there plans on behalf of the Government to address this issue? Do those plans include a mandatory regime and putting such a regime on a statutory footing? Is the Government actively considering the possibility of quarantine hotels?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-21 10:00:00+00:00	Brexit (Foreign Affairs): Statements	1	I want to focus on the issues of logistics, strategic connectivity and supply chains. There have been significant changes and some finger-pointing but it should be recognised that the issue of Brexit is hugely complex. In recent days, I have met a number of hauliers who outlined some issues they have with the lived experience of the current systems. There are unaccompanied trailers and they are getting information that they have been red routed just 30 minutes before they are due to pick up the trailers. There are examples of lorries being red routed for three days, meaning a 69-year-old has had to spend that time in tractor units that are not fit for purpose and not designed for overnight use. There is talk about systems where there is a need to transcribe manually 15-digit figures, talk about being shifted from terminal to terminal for inspection at Dublin Port, for example, from T11 to T10 to T7, and talk about phone numbers that just ring out. There is huge criticism of the IMDO report, which they say undermined the effort to secure additional ferry connectivity with the Continent. Again, there is the ask in regard to PSOs in terms of direct connectivity to the Continent, given the ferries are not there yet and there is a need for more capacity because existing ferries are overbooked. There is huge concern in regard to groupage, given the situation in Britain, and lorries are coming back but are not able to pick up back-loads because of the complexities of the new bureaucracy. There are also issues in regard to rules of origin.  There is a huge crisis. We should recognise that the average size of a haulage company in Ireland is 5.5 lorries, and there is a big challenge in terms of being in a position to deal with the new administrative burdens. The business model for many of these companies is up in the air. There are significant risks to the businesses themselves and also, from the State's perspective, there is significant risk to vital connectivity and to supply chains.  Will the Minister outline the model that will be in place to refine and improve these processes? There is significant duplication. There needs to be an acknowledgement that we are in the early stages of these new processes and there should be the opportunity to refine and improve them. Will stakeholders be involved in that process?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-21 10:00:00+00:00	Brexit (Foreign Affairs): Statements	2	Okay. I have two questions. There is a specific ask in regard to a six-month adjustment period, which is happening in Britain but is not happening here, reflecting the complexity of the situation. I also have a specific request in regard to the Brexit adjustment fund. Is it decided how it is going to be used? Can it be used for investment in the freight, distribution and logistics sector and to support haulage companies and for investment in port infrastructure, including traffic management systems? Will that be done on an all-Ireland basis, as said by my colleague?

Its five classrooms are less than half the size of standard primary school classrooms and are housed in dilapidated, pre-fabricated buildings. Walls are paper-thin, to the extent that they cannot support wall-mounted hand sanitiser. The floors have rotted, been replaced and are rotting again. Technical assessments on the need for a new school building were eventually conducted by the Department, but nothing more. I ask the Tánaiste to contact his Government colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and to ask them to engage directly with the staff and parents at Stepping Stones on this issue as a matter of urgency.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-04 10:00:00+00:00	Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 that seeks to reconfigure substantially our aviation and navigation regulation services. Sinn Féin is happy to support the Bill and will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage that we believe will improve on it. Before I delve into the issues of the Bill, I want to address the huge challenge facing workers in the aviation sector. I welcome the Minister of State's concluding remarks that if more is needed to be done, it will be done. There is a very firm opinion among workers in the sector that more does need to be done.  Sinn Féin fully supports the recent additional restrictions placed on international travel. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that we would like to see these strengthened further. Given the very high infection levels, the emergence of new coronavirus variants and the importance of protecting the vaccine roll-out, we believe very strict rules for international arrivals are essential during this time. There is still no mandatory quarantine, mandatory hotel quarantine or post-arrival testing. This is something that needs to change.  It must be realised, however, that the extension of public health restrictions means the extension of the current challenges faced by those working in the aviation and travel sector. Therefore, decisive action is needed now that will help the aviation sector survive, in the first instance, and recover more quickly. To counterbalance and to support the restrictions, the Minister for Transport must now step up and introduce measures to protect jobs in the aviation sector and the State's air connectivity at a time when international travel is significantly reduced. We have been calling for a range of reforms to help workers, but regrettably these have been resisted by the Government to date.  Since the outset of the pandemic, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, has been calling for a payment break for mortgage holders, in addition to protection from credit rating impairment and the accrual of additional interest during this time. This is permitted. As of 2 December 2020, the European Banking Authority, EBA, reactivated its payment break guidelines in light of the growth in Covid-19 infection rates throughout Europe. This position is now also a key ask of workers in the aviation sector. I urge the Minister of State and the Government to ensure that this protection is introduced. The refusal to date to introduce this protection is inexplicable and must change.  Pilots, cabin crew, ground staff, travel agents and others in the aviation and travel sectors have been some of the hardest hit workers due to the collapse of international travel during the pandemic. Many have not worked in almost a year, many have lost their jobs, while those remaining have suffered significant cuts to their pay during this time. The new restrictions are necessary, but will impact further on those workers and could lead to more job losses. The soundings from the sector are most grave. There is talk that it could be days and weeks, rather than months, before that prospect is upon us.  It is therefore crucial that the Government steps in now and provides support. There is no contradiction in supporting strongly the public health measures on the one hand and in calling for full support from the State to protect the sector and strategic connectivity on the other. Last year, we raised the issue of the €245 million connectivity fund and asked whether it could be used to support the sector. I received a reply to a parliamentary question last night on the current status of this money, which stated that responsibility for the management and control of it rests with the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. I ask the Minister of State if the Government has engaged with the NTMA on this issue, with a view to using the fund to support the aviation and travel sectors. With the selling of our shares in Aer Lingus, we lost an important seat at the table. It was a decision that Sinn Féin opposed at the time. We continue to be proved correct on the matter. We have lost a seat at the table where we could have influenced the decisions made in a crucially important airline, namely, Aer Lingus. I ask whether the Government has examined a cash for equity approach or an extended line of credit in respect of the airlines based here, to get them over the current challenge. If not, why not? There are lots of international comparisons, which I am sure the Minister of State has seen, in terms of the levels of state support that are being provided for the aviation sector. My primary concern in all of this is for the workers in communities right across the country. I am concerned with the international connectivity but also with the strategic regional importance of the aviation sector. It is something that absolutely has to be a number one priority for the Government. According to the international comparisons, Ireland is disproportionately dependent on aviation, yet we are really low in terms of the scale of support that is provided for the sector. We are not even on some of those charts.  Moving on to the Bill at hand, we are happy to support it. I have a number of questions for the Minister of State on various aspects of it. If she does not have time to respond today, she might get back to me with a response in advance of Committee Stage. The initial discussions on these provisions began before I was elected to the Dáil. I watched the discussion on the general scheme that took place at the transport committee in 2019. One of the topics that was raised at that time and not addressed was the cost of reconfiguration. I ask the Minister of State to come back to me with information on how that cost is broken down in terms of funding for staff, new buildings etc.  On the rights of workers, I welcome the comments by the Minister of State on the detail of the provisions in this regard. I would like more detail in terms of the level of engagement with workers, the impact these changes will have on them and what measures are being taken to ensure a smooth transition.  In regard to consumer rights, the Bill will see the dissolution of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, with its staff and functions transferring to the Irish Aviation Authority. As a result, the IAA, as regulator, will now hold responsibility for a number of areas, including consumer protection. It is my understanding that the Bill seeks to strengthen protections for consumers by providing enhancement powers to the regulator, including the creation of offences for not complying with a direction of the regulator and continuing daily offences for ongoing failures to comply with such a direction. We have seen time and again the weakness of our regulators. We have seen it, in particular, in the case of people who are waiting for flight vouchers and refunds and, worse again, those who are affected by ghost flights that left without them. They adhered to the public health advice and were penalised. There was no compensation for them and they have no protections. An Teachta O'Reilly and I wrote to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, before Christmas pointing to the weakness of consumer protections in this regard.  In the time remaining to me, I want to flag a number of amendments which, having gone through the Bill in detail, we intend to bring forward on Committee Stage. We believe there is an opportunity to improve it in a number of areas, not least in the area of the operation of the IAA. One of the provisions that we think should be included in the Bill relates to the need for the IAA to have a graduated fines system. The proposed removal of licence as the only stick is a drastic measure and the lack of provision for other sanctions weakens the IAA. There is a need for the IAA stakeholder forums to include all stakeholders and certain parties must not be allowed to demand the exclusion of others. There is a need for industrial relations issues to be comprehensively dealt with by the IAA or for it to have the power to refer them to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. We will argue that the legislation should underpin the peer support programmes across all airlines. Finally, there should be a charter for licence holders setting out the rights and responsibilities of each party and how parties should interact with each other.  I look forward to submitting these and other amendments in due course and to the later deliberations on the Bill. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to address these issues.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-10 10:00:00+00:00	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	1	I will focus my comments and questions on international travel and the aviation sector and colleagues will pick up on other issues.  The British Government's announcement on the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine from Monday next completely exposed the Irish Government's excuses and delays in this area. Mandatory hotel quarantine can be done and there is no reason it should not be done here for all non-essential arrivals. The advice from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has been crystal clear on this. They stated, as recently as 14 January, that the discretionary elements of quarantine and post-arrival testing should be removed. They also stated that every effort should be made to remove these. Neither direction has been followed. Yet again, the public health advice has been shelved during this pandemic. While the Administration in London announced detailed plans for self-funded ten-day quarantines with strict measures and severe penalties for breaches, the Minister and his colleagues are still at the stage of confusion and indecision. It also announced mandatory testing for all travellers on days two and eight post arrival, something that Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for in Ireland but that the Government has inexplicitly resisted.  We have had nearly a year of inadequate and reactionary measures on international travel that have protected neither lives nor livelihoods. Every measure introduced to date has been half-baked. On 1 June, Sinn Féin stated that a traffic light system for international travel should be examined. Unbelievably, we had to wait until November before it was introduced, and then only at the behest of the EU. The Government waited until the passenger locator form was ignored   It is incredible that NPHET issued advice on 14 January, the Government responded and within hours, its proposals and measures were proven inadequate. I cannot understand how no lessons have been learned. The Government is constantly on the back foot as regards international travel. Leaving our ports of entry wide open during a pandemic has not benefited anyone over the past year. It has not helped aviation workers, kept the travel sector afloat, kept out Covid variants or reduced infections on our island. We know there are combined variants with increased infectivity, transmissibility and mortality levels associated with them.  The Government's measures have not worked and will not work. It needs to go back to the drawing board yet again. A system of hotel quarantine for all non-essential arrivals needs to be introduced immediately until such time as our infection levels drop, our health system is not at risk of being overwhelmed and the vaccine roll-out is more advanced. We realise that this means an extension of the current challenges facing those working in the aviation and travel sectors but decisive action now, with adequate sector-specific supports, will help these industries recover more quickly. Britain is introducing mandatory quarantine for arrivals from 33 countries, covering 800 million people. The Government has stated that it intends to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for arrivals from just two countries, Brazil and South Africa, at some future date as yet unknown.  Has the Minister's counterpart in London been in contact with him about Ireland being used as a back door into Britain to avoid the latter's quarantine measures? When will the Government introduce a more comprehensive list of countries to which hotel quarantine will apply?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-10 10:00:00+00:00	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	2	I appreciate that the numbers are down significantly but the risk is not a relative one. It is not a year-on-year comparison. The risk is a real one, given the numbers coming through. If we do not have an adequate system of checks and controls, it will not matter how few are travelling here. All that matters is how many come to Ireland with Covid, particularly its variants.  I wish to raise the related issue of the aviation and travel sectors and the supports for same, given the public health measures' significant impact on them. The Government's approach has not just failed to protect the population from further infection but has also done no favours for the aviation and travel sectors. Pilots, cabin crew, ground staff and travel agents have raised issues. They appeared before a committee yesterday. Significant proposals have been made. The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has pointed to other countries. For example, there has been a $900 million investment in Air New Zealand. Air France has got €7 billion and Lufthansa €10 billion. Fórsa, SIPTU and Connect Trade Union pointed towards a sector-specific intervention and supports based on the German model. When I asked parliamentary questions last week, I was given no figures for the supports for individual airlines. I read in the newspapers that the figure was €150 million. Is that the case and has it been provided? What scale of support is available for individual airlines and, as importantly, workers in the sector? What will the Government do?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-24 10:00:00+00:00	Health (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. To begin, I must ask why the Minister for Transport is not here taking this Bill through the House. Where is the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today? He should be anchoring this Bill but he is missing in action. I mean no disrespect to the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, but their responsibility and focus should be entirely on the health system and the critical vaccination roll-out. It is wholly inappropriate that the hotel quarantine Bill was loaded on the Department of Health. It is clear the Bill was dumped on the Minister, which is absolutely not helpful. It was a selfish move by the Minister's Cabinet colleagues, who shirked their responsibility in this area.  While Sinn Féin welcomes the broad thrust of this Bill, and I thank the departmental officials for their briefing on Monday, it will come as no surprise to hear we do not believe this Bill goes far enough. NPHET set the bar on 14 January when it recommended ""that every effort be made to ensure that discretion as it currently applies to the need for restriction of movements and PCR-testing post-arrival in Ireland is removed"". The question is whether we can do more to limit discretion on restriction of movements and PCR testing post arrival. When we look at this Bill and the wider regime, the answer is absolutely clear. Yes, we can; yes, we should; and yes, we must.  Limiting the provisions of this Bill to arrivals from just 20 countries is wholly inadequate. One of our amendments seeks to extend mandatory hotel quarantine to arrivals from all  Central to the Government's argument against our proposals is that it wants to continue with the approach of reacting to variants or outbreaks in other countries as they arise. This does not work and will not work. The Government has stated, as if it were a badge of honour, that on first hearing of the British variant it imposed a travel ban the next day. What decisive action. While this is how the Government intends to carry on, did it work? It did not, not by a million miles, as 90% of all cases here are now from that exact variant.  The Minister knows that by the time variants are discovered in other countries, it is too late and the ship has sailed, both literally and figuratively. The Government's plan runs contrary to the fundamental principles of outbreak management and prevention. For 170 or 180-odd countries in the world, we will rely on mandatory quarantine at home. Let us just be straight with people. There is no such thing as mandatory quarantine at home. It is a misnomer and does not exist. It cannot be monitored or enforced. It is mandatory in name only and is quarantine in name only. It means nothing and as a result, this entire plan is wholly inadequate.  This is why the collective Opposition and the vast majority of people are asking for proactive measures in this regard. That is why nothing less than including all countries in this will work. We must take a cautious approach until the vaccination programme is more advanced and more information about variants is known. The Government acknowledges this and we must take measures that will help allow our population get back to some level of normal life. The best way to do that is to drive the virus down and to prevent it and new variants from reseeding. Closing the door to unchecked international travel for the time being should be one part of this plan. Sinn Féin’s amendments deliver that and I urge the Minister to reconsider his position.  Related to the need for more comprehensive mandatory hotel quarantine is the urgent need to expand the checks and balances currently in place. Number one must be the introduction of a mandatory PCR test post arrival for all non-essential travel. A pre-departure test within the previous 72 hours, as currently required, is not enough. The Minister knows this and the experts have told him. NPHET's modelling indicates that even the best-performing pre-departure Covid-19 tests will miss up to 40% of cases within that 72-hour period. We have submitted another amendment that would require a post-arrival test for all non-essential travellers, regardless of whether they are in hotel quarantine. The Minister should accept it.  Currently, people are arriving back into the State and possibly quarantining in their homes. They are mixing with family members or housemates and without testing post arrival, this has the potential to lead to significant numbers of clusters. Post-arrival mandatory testing must be introduced. It is about closing the net and managing and minimising the risk. We have all heard about the Swiss cheese model and the layers of protection. Pre-departure testing will miss up to 40% of cases. When combined with a post-arrival test on day 5, it will miss up to 15% of cases, according to the submission of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication Networks. It is true that 15% is much better than 40%. NPHET set the bar, and on the issue of post-arrival testing, the Minister has not even tied his laces.  It is a similar case with the practicalities of the proposed regime. Given the current state of affairs, it will happen in very limited circumstances and maybe none but technically, someone landing in Belfast and living in the South is expected to voluntarily present at a designated facility. The question arises as to what happens if one does not. There are fines and penalties, which is fair enough. However, to ensure that this measure is implementable and enforceable, passenger data must be shared in real time between Belfast and Dublin, in order that the authorities here know who should be presenting at a designated facility and can contact them if they do not. It makes sense and we have submitted an amendment in this regard. I ask the Minister to support it.  Finally, we must acknowledge the impact that all of this will have on the aviation sector. I was genuinely taken aback to hear the response of the Tánaiste in the House last week when I raised this matter with him. In a highly disingenuous way, he suggested that asking for mandatory hotel quarantine and advocating for support for the aviation sector was trying to have it both ways. That is absolute nonsense. Of course, we realise that extra measures will add further to the difficulties in the aviation and travel sectors but look at those industries now. Look at what the Government's policies have achieved. The summer of 2020 was lost and now we are being told that the summer of 2021 will be lost. If we do not get ahead of this virus, more months and jobs will be lost.  Government half-measures and this permanent purgatory will not do. The Government’s approach to aviation has been disgraceful. It has failed to support the sector and its workers. The level of State supports is a fraction of what is required. The Government has turned a blind eye to ghost flights leaving with people’s money. We are told that nothing can be done. It has turned a blind eye to loyal customers being given the runaround on refunds and vouchers and being gouged on rescheduling fees. It has turned a blind eye on loyal workers being denied their short-time work support and to Aer Lingus strategically moving its operations elsewhere. The Minister wrote to me this morning, stating that the privatisation of Aer Lingus is ""a positive evolution for the company"". That is absolutely incredible. It is completely outrageous for the Tánaiste to come into the Dáil and claim that this half-baked plan, which is in front of us today, is about protecting aviation. It is no wonder that aviation sector workers are at their wits' end.   The Government cannot continue to ignore the need for crucial protections for workers. Tailored supports must be introduced for workers in the aviation industry who are facing months more of uncertainty and possible further job losses. The Government is sitting on a quarter of a billion euro in the so-called connectivity fund. This must be used. Massive investment is needed to protect aviation. It should come with conditions, including the protection of workers, jobs, strategic connectivity, and delivery on climate change goals. The Government has the power to do this. The Minister should stop pretending that there is some happy balance to be struck somewhere between 20 and 200-odd countries. It is an insult to ordinary workers who are looking to the Minister and the Government for hope. Instead, they are being used as a political football.  This legislation is important. It has come very late but at a crucial juncture in our effort to get ahead of this virus. Sinn Féin has proposed a number of amendments. I ask the Minister to consider and adopt them."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-22 10:00:00+01:00	Covid Restrictions Support Scheme Regulations and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme Regulations: Motions	1	I wish to raise a couple of issues with the Minister this afternoon. I ask that the Government look into them as soon as possible as they remain unresolved despite repeated requests for action.  The first issue relates to aviation workers, specifically Aer Lingus employees. My colleague, Teachta O'Reilly, referenced this point. The pandemic and resulting necessary travel restrictions have had a massive impact on workers in the sector. This hardship has been compounded by repeated failures of the social welfare system to support them when they need it most. Last year, we ran into issues where the airline refused to sign forms correctly for workers on the short-term work support scheme. Workers were continuously pushed from pillar to post by the company and the Department for Social Protection. This was eventually resolved for the temporary wages subsidy scheme, TWSS, after we raised it repeatedly with the Minister and with the airline. A satisfactory resolution or fair solution was never found for the EWSS.  Now, cabin crew and other staff are getting notifications from their social welfare offices that their period on jobseeker's benefit is coming to an end and they will have to face a similar further substantial cut in pay in the time head. What has been suggested for them? A further reduction in hours. That is entirely unsatisfactory as a proposal. It is absolutely brutal that this would be suggested. These workers are barely getting by as it is. It is scandalous that the rug is being pulled from under them at this point. They cannot get clarity on it. My colleague, Deputy Clarke, raised the issue with the Tánaiste earlier and, amazingly, he did not seem to understand that a Department, of which he was formerly the head, was responsible for Xs and Os.  We call on the Minister, therefore, to intervene and work with his colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to address this issue as a matter of priority to ensure aviation workers continue to be supported by the wage subsidy scheme, which is welcome, and other necessary social welfare supports. Aviation workers and their unions have called for a German-style wage support. I echo that call here.  My second point relates to another group of transport workers who have been severely impacted over the last 12 months. Taxi drivers have seen their business disappear and their income cut massively. These workers have had to continue to cover expensive overheads for their vehicles and the income supports put in place for them simply do not cover it. Thousands of drivers in the sector are over the age of 66, meaning they are not entitled to the pandemic employment payment, PUP.  We called for tailored supports for this sector to ensure taxi drivers are supported but this request has fallen on deaf ears. In the North, for example, there is a simple, targeted £3,000 grant. The Minister for Transport here seems to be living in a parallel universe to taxi drivers. The suggestion that the main initiative by this Government is a grant for electric vehicles, EV, is simply completely out of touch. A direct and focused support for this sector is needed or it will not survive. It is a case of survival and support rather than cosmetics on the outside.

I have seen it over many years in regards to groups such as the Kells Anglers which have been the custodians of the River Blackwater and look after its stock and quality.  In recent weeks, the communities along the River Boyne rallied in defence of it. In the space of a number of days, over 6,000 people in a small rural area joined an online campaign in support of the environment and the River Boyne. The ""Save the Boyne"" campaign now has over 8,100 followers. There is a planning application that will be judged on its own merits and I will not get into that. I commend the forum and its active members and the local angling clubs, community groups and businesses on their efforts and interest in protecting their environment and on protecting our inland waterways. It was something to be proud of and to be commended.  On their behalf, Government needs to work with these communities and support them. That goes for the Government's agencies as well, in terms of local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Irish Water and other authorities. From my experience as a public representative and working with these communities, they have a mixed experience of working with these agencies that have an official responsibility to protect our natural and built heritage.  On a related point, I raise the Hill of Tara. As the Minister of State knows, it is one of the richest archeological landscapes in Ireland. Over 230,000 people visit the Hill of Tara on an annual basis. I do not live far from it. Increasing numbers of people have visited during Covid-19. Where is the Hill of Tara conservation management plan? It is work in progress since 2018. I commend stakeholders such as the local Rathfeigh Skyne Tara, RST, group and the Friends of Tara group. It is clear what needs to be done to conserve the area, but also to enhance it in terms of public amenities, parking, toilet facilities and interpretive centres. There is significant opportunity which needs to be grasped. I encourage the Minister of State to provide an update and to ensure the work gets done."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	questions	English	2021-05-20 09:00:00+01:00	Questions on Promised Legislation	1	Over 200,000 people are now waiting for a driving theory test or a driving test. This is having a huge impact on people, particularly young people. Driving tests are happening in a limited way. Theory tests are completely closed, more or less, since October. This is despite the fact that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is of the firm opinion that the theory test can be conducted safely during Covid restrictions. Mr. Declan Naughton from the RSA said as much on radio recently. Mr. Naughton stated that if there is a view that the theory test is unsafe for any reason, those in the RSA would love to get to show that with robust anti-Covid measures it is safe. He pointed to the fact that 42,000 driving tests had been conducted since January in even more confined conditions and with no Covid cases. Relating to theory tests, Mr. Naughton stated that the RSA would love the opportunity to demonstrate to public health personnel that it is safe to open. I ask the Minister with responsibility for this area whether a risk assessment has taken place. If not, why not? Most importantly, when will the theory tests reopen?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-20 09:00:00+01:00	Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	2	I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Murchú, Cronin and Donnelly. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It has been some time coming. Many people are interested in the issue and would have liked to see the Bill being brought forward sooner. Its provisions will be important for those affected, particularly small family farmers and small business owners. It will provide them with some solace and protection and will also ensure, in some part, that their businesses and farms are sustainable and viable. That is a really important point for our rural communities, in particular, and is to be welcomed.  It also speaks to the greater point about models of care and the nursing homes support scheme. There are very significant challenges. Those of us interested in the demographics and the nature of our health services know that we have a very particular challenge in Ireland in sustaining nursing home support and care of the elderly. We all want to see a model that provides for people living at home for as long as possible. That is an important element. Nursing homes have an important role to play, but much needs to be done to ensure that older people can live at home for as long as possible.   Regarding the role of carers and the need to support them to care for people in their homes, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, brought forward a charter for carers. A number of important measures would be of significant benefit in terms of practical supports for carers, such as talk therapy and expanding GP visit cards, in addition to increasing and expanding carer's allowance, carer's benefit and support grants. The introduction of a discretionary grant for carers would be another important measure that would be a significant positive. I know many who are struggling to pay their heating and electricity bills, such is the nature of their work and, unfortunately, the way in which they are valued by this State. It is well recognised that carers play a major role in providing care, which is not valued in the way it should be. That issue needs to be addressed.  The greater point about the role of the nursing homes scheme is that it has developed in a largely uncontrolled way. I see it in my county of Meath, where there was much speculation, general tax breaks and incentives for people to build nursing homes. People have ended up in that sector for reasons other than having a traditional background in healthcare provision and delivery. That, in and of itself, raises the real need for a strong role for HIQA, but also for ensuring maintenance of high standards, which includes the terms and conditions of employment.   The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, certainly in its first wave, many of the weaknesses within the system. We will have an opportunity to address that. Many people working in the sector are dedicated and tremendously hard-working. It would be to everybody's benefit to put in place robust standards and protections for staff, workers and the residents themselves. That will be important going forward as the growing ageing population puts pressure on those services. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and there will be further opportunities to develop it as well.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-25 14:00:00+01:00	International Travel and Aviation: Statements	1	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on international travel. For the first time in almost a year and a half there is light at the end of the tunnel, and that is very welcome. The successful vaccination roll out to date in Ireland, Britain, across Europe and the United States has radically changed the outlook for international travel in a way that we all hoped it would.  As my party's spokesperson on transport and a Deputy representing the constituency of Meath East, I am very familiar with the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector and its workers. I have been in touch with hundreds of those workers individually, and their representatives, over the past 14 months. They have had hours and pay cut and hundreds of jobs have been permanently lost. Pilots demonstrated yesterday and are demonstrating again today. Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications will hear from cabin crew. They are frustrated with the Covid restrictions and fear for their future. They are equally frustrated with the lack of clarity from Government and the lack of a plan and details on the reopening of international travel, and when and how it will happen.   The lack of clarity and planning and always being behind, reacting and on the back foot is a constant feature of the Government's approach to international travel. Since the outset of the pandemic, Sinn Féin's position has been absolutely clear. We called for robust checks and controls at our ports and airports, including pre-departure and post-arrival testing, 100% follow-up and a support package for workers and the industry to protect jobs and strategic connectivity.   Last May, Sinn Féin called for temperature screening at airports, mandatory passenger locator forms, 100% follow-up and an all-Ireland approach. In June, we again called for this and for a traffic light system and international travel based on Covid risk profiles. In July we called for mandatory PCR testing. In September, when representatives from NPHET attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I called for antigen testing to be rolled out as an improvement on the voluntary and expensive PCR testing regime.  The Government did not do any of that. Instead, for the entirety of 2020 there was a complete failure by Government to do anything. Month after month we heard about passenger locator forms follow-up. The figures for this were 6%, 8% and 18%, which was, I understand, the highest rate recorded. It is incredible to think about that. We did not introduce mandatory testing for international travel until we were reporting 8,000 cases a day.  The failure on the part of the Government to implement proper safety checks and protocols at our ports of entry to show that international travel could happen safely led to a total breakdown in public confidence in international travel. With that track record, a Government at sea, public confidence on the floor, 8,000 cases a day and clear public health advice, the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine was an inevitable and necessary measure at a time when we could not move 2 km from home, the vaccine roll-out had barely started and variants of concern were ravaging South Africa, Brazil and the UK.  ICUs were eating into surge capacity. As a temporary measure, a circuit breaker, that is, mandatory hotel quarantine, was necessary. It should have been matched with funding to protect jobs and strategic connectivity. Last week, the Minister and the Minister of State indicated that by the end of June the sector will have received €300 million in supports. At the weekend, that figure became €500 million. Even at that, it does not compare well with other countries. Who bears the brunt? Workers bear the brunt, particularly those who lost their jobs. Customers, who are waiting for refunds and vouchers or who lost money because airlines flew empty planes, also bear the brunt. The Government turned a blind eye to that.  From its lowest ebb, the sector is again looking to the Government. The safe return to international travel will have to be carefully planned and managed. No one wants to risk the gains and huge sacrifices we have made in recent months. It might be expecting too much from a Government that has failed at every turn to put the systems in place and build confidence in them, but there is reason to be hopeful. Vaccines have changed everything and have presented us with opportunities. Data sharing will continue to be essential. The digital Covid-19 certificate will provide an opportunity in this regard. It is a single platform with Covid-19 status, vaccine, antibodies and negative tests. This can enable a safe return to international travel but we still do not know how or when it will be implemented here. There is speculation that there are IT delays. I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to address those concerns and ensure that we are ready. We also need to share data, North and South. There has been considerable Government resistance in this regard.  Testing will continue to be essential. The Minister and the Minister of State need to listen to the Government's chief scientific adviser. Professor Mark Ferguson appeared before the transport committee a few weeks ago and outlined the role antigen testing can play in the safe reopening of international travel. He pointed to international research in Britain, Italy and the United States. PCR testing is prohibitively expensive, is done 72 hours pre-departure and on its own, from a public health perspective, is limited. According to Professor Ferguson, the Government's chief scientific adviser, serial antigen testing, pre-departure and post-arrival in the context of continuing vaccine roll-out, can potentially replace the need for a PCR test and quarantine at home.  The transport committee and, as the Minister of State indicated, the National Civil Aviation Forum have been calling on the Government to pilot this. I ask the Minister of State to see that this happens. The fact that vaccine roll-out is most advanced in Britain, the United States and the EU, the places people from Ireland travel to and from most, offers an opportunity. We have to be continually mindful of public health advice and the patterns of Covid-19 spread. We also have to mindful of the potential pitfalls and, in particular, variants of concern. With the right systems in place, however, we can safely extract ourselves from the current restrictions, including home and hotel quarantine, as we all hoped and always intended.  This Government has always been on the back foot when it comes to international travel. On Friday, the hundreds of thousands of workers in the sector and related sectors will want to see a clear plan on how the systems will work and when they will come into effect. It is the least they deserve.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-16 09:10:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	1	I move amendment No. 1: In page 5, line 8, to delete “the transition” and substitute “a just transition”. I am disappointed to see reflected in the Bill that the Government has taken nothing on board from the 12 hours of Committee Stage scrutiny we had on this Bill last week. Some 231 amendments from Opposition politicians were put forward and not only did the Minister refuse to accept any of them, he also failed to bring forward any of his own based on what was said at the lengthy Committee Stage hearings. We highlighted a plethora of areas that need to be addressed in this Bill and Sinn Féin brought forward amendments in a number of these areas, including on: the definition of a just transition and climate justice; the process of appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council; the investor-state dispute mechanisms and their potential impact on climate action, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA; addressing the anomaly of the Government not being considered a relevant body; fracking; the need for impact assessments for specific areas; and democratic oversight of climate action plans. Some of those amendments were ruled out of order and none of them was accepted. That is a very disappointing approach that undermines the cross-party approach that should have been taken to such major legislation, which will set out a framework for the next 30 years. We have resubmitted a number of amendments on Report Stage and I urge the Minister to improve the aspects of the Bill that we have identified.  One major area of concern is around the just transition aspect of the Bill, or the lack thereof, and that concern is reflected in amendment No. 1. We absolutely recognise the urgent need to combat climate change but we also want to ensure that decisions taken now and into the future do not disproportionately affect those who can least afford it. Although this Bill will not detail the policy decisions to be taken, it will outline the considerations that must be taken into account when proposing specific actions. We want to make sure the decisions taken to meet the ambitious targets contained in this Bill are progressive and fair, and have local communities at their core. Our amendments, specifically those dealing with just transition and climate justice, seek to achieve that. It is vital that this principle is enshrined in the legislation. This is where successive Governments have failed time and again. They have left people behind. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have opted all too comfortably for punitive measures which hurt the most vulnerable in our society. As a result, for the vast majority of ordinary families, climate action is associated with cost. The climate Bill must not be blind to the concerns of local communities. If we are to successfully move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a carbon neutral economy, we need a plan that brings communities with us, not one that penalises them or forgets about them altogether.  Sinn Féin’s amendments Nos. 1, 22 and 23 all refer to the need for the inclusion of a definition of a just transition and just transition principles.  'just transition principles’ means the importance of taking action to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases in a way which— (a) supports environmentally and socially sustainable jobs, (b) supports low-carbon investment and infrastructure, (c) develops and maintains social consensus through engagement with workers, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organisations, representatives of the interests of business and industry and such other persons as the Ministers consider appropriate, (d) creates decent, fair, and high-value work in a way which does not negatively affect the current workforce and overall economy, (e) contributes to resource efficient and sustainable economic approaches which help to address inequality and poverty.

It is really important we have an opportunity to vote on the question of a just transition. It should be at the very heart of this Bill.

Ireland is the only country that was not in compliance with the regulations. We have missed this deadline, although it was not a deadline for us. There are many who are concerned we will miss the deadline of 19 July. We are told we will be emailed our vaccine record but nobody submitted their email address when they applied for the vaccine and there is concern in that regard. Can the Tánaiste guarantee that the system will be live and operational by 19 July? In terms of the potential for an expanded role for a certificate, will antigen testing be incorporated in the system if it is used domestically, but also in terms of international travel?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-09-29 09:12:00+01:00	Data Centre Moratorium: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy Whitmore and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this timely and necessary motion. What we have unfolding before us, particularly in recent months, is a picture of abject failure on behalf of successive Governments to prepare and manage energy and electricity policy, and supply and demand, adequately. Amber alerts are now a common feature, electricity outages are increasingly common and avoiding blackouts cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, this Government will bend over backwards to facilitate the entry of energy-sapping data centres into the market. As we now have about 70 of them, we think it is a good idea to get the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to have a look at their impact – now, not before we started granting permissions.  It is not as if the Minister has not been warned. My party has for years warned about this high-wire act. In our Powering Ireland 2030 document, published in 2018, we pointed to the need to manage demand, to curtail the expansion of data centres and to take control. These warnings, and the warnings from EirGrid and the CRU, appear to be falling on deaf ears in Government Buildings, so I think it is right that the Dáil now calls for an emergency brake on the future development of data centres.  We appreciate the need for data centres. They provide a vital service that keeps many of the digital aspects of our lives running but it is clear the uncontrolled and ill-conceived Government policy, which has encouraged the rampant expansion of data centres here, is now threatening the electricity supply to Irish households and businesses, which is simply unacceptable.  The last Fine Gael Government set a target of making Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with absolutely no thought about the impact this would have on our carbon emissions or on electricity supply. The current Government has not changed approach. On the one hand, it rolls out the red carpet for data centres while, on the other, it postpones renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions, it dithers with the roll-out of offshore wind - just listen to Wind Energy Ireland - and it dithers with microgeneration, which is always just around the corner but still not here.  EirGrid and the CRU have warned that rolling blackouts are possible if action is not taken on the unprecedented growth of electricity demand from data centres. The Minister added to these concerns on the national airwaves this morning. Make no mistake about it: this crisis, and it is a crisis, is a direct result of incoherent Government policies pursued by Fine Gael in recent years and continued by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  In the last four years, data centre demand has grown by 2,400 GW hours, the equivalent of 560,000 homes. If allowed to continue, current and planned data centres could consume anywhere between 25% and 70% of peak electricity demand by 2030. This simply is not feasible or sustainable. It is reckless and dangerous. Based on the track record of the three Government parties, it risks the lights going out and widespread social unrest, not to mention the irreparable damage it will do to the climate and the climate movement. The growth of data centres is already jeopardising the State’s 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51%, a commitment that is less than three months old. Research carried out by   In the meantime, we roll out the red carpet. Data centres benefit from our PSO, among other things. They do not pay their fair share. PSO is levied at peak demand but, of course, data centres have a gigantic but steady demand so they do better, while little old women in my constituency are forced to do their washing in the middle of the night to save a few cent. Then, there are the tax reliefs that this Government knows nothing about. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party: it is almost like hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, highlighted that the Minister for Finance does not know the total value of tax reliefs that have been gifted to companies through capital allowances claimed against their data centre investment. The Minister for Finance does not know. It is literally unbelievable. From listening to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today, it sounds like he does not know either. At the root of this motion, in my opinion, is an absolute lack of confidence that this Government has this real energy challenge in hand or that it is in control. I share that concern. I look at the Government amendment, I hear the Minister on the national airwaves, I hear him speak this morning, and I am not inspired. In fact, it is the opposite. Deputy Ryan is the Minister responsible. This is the Government responsible, but it points to EirGrid and the CRU, stating that management of the impact of electricity demand on the grid is more appropriately dealt with through regulatory measures in the electricity sector. That is not good enough. Make no mistake about it: if the lights go out, the Minister and the Government will be the ones held accountable.  The threat now posed to the electricity system will not just have negative consequences for households and businesses; it will also have a massively damaging effect on Ireland’s international reputation. The prospect of the CRU’s final direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks, as the Minister points out in his amendment, is not enough. The truth is that it is an absolute indictment of the Government that we have ever got to this point, in 2021, in Ireland. The Government would do well to heed the warnings and act without delay.

That is significant and a clear case of mismanagement. The red carpet is rolled out on the demand side and the Government dithers on the supply side. Renewable energy support scheme, RESS, auctions have been postponed. Wind Energy Ireland maintains that offshore projects under the watch of this Government have been delayed due to the lack of a framework and the microgeneration scheme continues to be promised mañana. I ask the Taoiseach to expedite the implementation of the offshore wind legislation. Those in the sector maintain that because there is no framework, projects are being delayed. When will the microgeneration scheme be introduced? We have not seen that legislation.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-06 09:10:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I thank People Before Profit-Solidarity for tabling this motion. This year, workers and families will be facing extraordinarily high energy costs at a time when most can least afford them. There have been over 30 price hike announcements from Irish energy suppliers since the start of the year, with some suppliers raising prices on multiple occasions. This is on top of other spiralling costs that the Government has completely failed to regulate, including rent, childcare, insurance and the basket of shopping; the list goes on. The Government does not seem to recognise the real hardship many people are facing due to these constant price hikes and has failed to bring forward any meaningful solutions for people.  Euro finance ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the energy crisis and we heard calls for strong co-ordinated action on this. Some EU member states, such as Spain, France and Italy, are already acting unilaterally and with appropriate urgency. In Ireland, the Government sits on its hands. It is essential emergency action is taken here to protect households from crippling energy price hikes. Whether it is through the consumer Acts or another mechanism, Ministers cannot sit on their hands as people go cold, hungry or potentially die as they struggle to cope with heating bills this winter. These huge price rises are an emergency and need to be treated as such in the budget announcement next week.  There are measures the Government can take. Last year, I published a Bill that would ban utility disconnections during the fuel allowance season. This is an important protection that should be introduced. We cannot have a position where those facing financial difficulty have their gas or electricity cut off in the middle of winter for failure to meet their bills on time. Even having the threat of disconnections hanging over families is incredibly stressful. Yesterday, at a committee meeting, we heard from representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities on this issue. Other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium, have winter disconnection bans and such a protection should also be introduced here.  The electricity public service obligation, PSO, must be reformed. It should be levied on overall demand, not peak demand as is now the case. Residential consumers are responsible for approximately 42% of peak demand but only 28% of total demand. Industrial consumers, meanwhile, are responsible for 47% of peak demand and 44% of overall demand. Despite contributing less to overall demand than industrial users, residential electricity users' outsized contribution to peak demand means they are apportioned an outsized share of the PSO. We want to change this to ensure large electricity users, such as data centres, pay their fair share of the PSO based on their overall demand for electricity, rather than ordinary households shouldering the heaviest burden.  To add absolute insult to injury for families, the Government still intends to carry on, with complete disregard, with carbon tax hikes, adding to the burden on families, with an extra €1.50 on a fill of motor fuel, an extra €13 on the average gas bill and an extra €20 per tank of home heating oil. What is the Government's argument for this? We have heard the money will be used to offset carbon impact and we need it anyway to invest in climate projects. The real world is a foreign place for this Government. The truth, of course, is that welfare supports go nowhere near covering the impact of these hikes. What about the promised climate action spend? How many houses have been retrofitted in the past year? The number is little or none. How many cold homes have been insulated? How many heat pumps have been installed? It is a fraction of what was committed to and an even smaller fraction of what is needed.  How many new public transport routes have been provided? There has been none, not even one. I have repeatedly seen a response from the National Transport Authority indicating ""2021 does not include provision for the introduction of new or improved services in these areas"". In my county I can think of communities like Carlanstown, which appears in our local newspaper this week and has no service. Kentstown is a village that had a service years ago, when there was just one housing estate in the place, and now it has no service, despite having a far greater population. Elsewhere, existing services to Dublin City University have been reduced.  All of this is happening while the Government is subsidising millionaires to drive electric supercars and running our energy system to the brink of collapse to facilitate big technology foreign direct investment. It is really a case of one rule for some and another for the rest of us. This Government just does not get it. It is out of touch, out of ideas and with any good luck for the Irish people, it is running out of time fast."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-13 10:30:00+01:00	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	1	"In the time available to me, I want to contest the argument made by various Government representatives in support of the claim by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday that: ""Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off..."". I heard George Lee make the same statement yesterday on ""Six One News"". It is my understanding that this claim is made on the back of an Economic and Social Research Institute report, Carbon Taxes, Poverty and Compensation Options, which was published in October 2020. That research deserves further scrutiny given the influence it is now having. Like any research, it has its limitations, and those limitations need to be discussed. I want to make five points in that regard.  First, the authors say they do not account for changes in prices beyond those directly arising from the higher carbon tax. They do not account for the higher prices firms charge for their products because of changes to input prices. This is significant because we know the wholesale price of natural gas has increased by 250% since January. Brent crude oil is at more than $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. On my reading of the paper, that is not factored into the model.  Second, the report notes that energy poverty is beset with measurement issues. It also notes that there was a commitment in the 2016 strategy to combat energy poverty to establish an energy poverty advisory group to review and report to the Minister on an appropriate methodology for measuring and tracking energy poverty levels in Ireland. This would be an important thing to do if there was a real wish to understand and address energy poverty in the midst of runaway energy costs and ensure a just transition. However, this group has yet to be convened or to meet. The ESRI researchers were constrained in this regard by Government action. When they assessed the impact of the range of redistributive measures on energy poverty, they found that at disposable incomes of greater than 10%, 15% and 20% after housing costs, none had a mitigating effect. That is there in black and white on page 11 of the report.  Third, in making the case that energy or fuel poverty is primarily one of inadequate resources, the researchers abandoned the energy poverty measurement and moved to the official at-risk-of-poverty rate. That is a questionable move in and of itself. We should also note that the eight mitigating measures they assessed do not map directly to the measures taken by Government. Option B, for example, refers to a €6.50, rather than a €5, rise in the fuel allowance. I raise this as another limitation in terms of the conclusions that are being drawn by Government spokespersons.  Fourth, in regard to the impact on specific groups, the report concludes: In terms of geographic impact, an increase in the carbon tax would disproportionately affect those living in rural areas, with or without any compensation measures. However, as [shown elsewhere], this is driven by the particularly large effects on those living in rural areas who commute long distances to work by car. Given the ongoing pandemic and public health advice to work from home where possible, such differential impacts may be moderated by a reduction in long-distance commuting by car. That argument hardly holds true now and the differential impacts will not be moderated.  My final point relates to renters, in respect of whom the report authors conclude: Renters - both in the private and social sector - would be left on average better-off by those measures which raised the personal rate of working-age benefit payments or Increases for Qualified Children... This is because those renting are disproportionately likely to be in receipt of a social welfare payment. The problem with aggregate data is that they lead to the drawing of aggregate conclusions when we know the picture is far from uniform within and between groups. That has been clearly shown by a number of people who have taken the time to map energy poverty in Ireland and look at the risk index. The picture is not uniform and hundreds of thousands of renters are not in receipt of social welfare payments. They got no relief in the budget yesterday and are being penalised with carbon taxes. It is really important that we dig down into the detail of the data on which the claims that are being made by Government representatives are based. I call on the Government to publish the data from which it derives the claim that there has been relief for the real impact of the carbon taxes. On my reading of the document on which it is relying in this regard, the evidence is not there."

Thousands of children were excluded from the scheme due to the infamous concessionary ticket classification. We were promised that this would be kept under review. Parents and Bus Éireann were looking towards 22 October for the possible reintroduction of 100% refunds, which would ordinarily have been issued, but they have been held back.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Rising Costs and Supply Security for Fuel and Energy: Motion [Private Members]	1	"It has been merely a number of weeks since we previously debated a motion on energy prices. This shows how important this issue is. In these few weeks we have witnessed yet more price hikes from suppliers but we have seen absolutely no action from the Government to address the crisis. There have been more than 35 price hike announcements from Irish suppliers this year. They are having a crippling effect on families. A dual customer of Flogas, for example, will pay €1,385 more this year than last. This is an unprecedented increase in costs. The Government seems to be blind to this reality. Where are workers and families supposed to get this extra money? The sky-high cost of living driven by out-of-control rents, and we will hear more on this today, along with childcare costs and other costs have put people to the pin of their collar and beyond. Thousands of families will soon have to turn off their heating or put on extra layers of clothing to keep the heating off in the depths of winter as they simply will not have the money to meet these bills.  Not only is the Government failing to act but it is contributing to the crisis. According to figures from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, 16.2% of an electricity bill is made up of Government charges in VAT and the public service obligation, PSO, levy while 17.4% of gas bills are made up of Government charges comprising carbon tax and VAT. This is before excise and other duties. In agreeing to exacerbate this issue by increasing the carbon tax, pushing up gas and home heating oil prices even further, the Government is both tone deaf and belligerent. Sinn Féin has consistently highlighted the unfairness of the carbon tax on heating people's homes when they have no alternative. This is certainly the case for many families and it is most certainly the case for haulage companies and others dependent on fuel. It is a punitive measure.  One argument the Government makes in defence of the punitive carbon tax is that some of it, a fraction of it, will be recycled to assist those who need it most but this argument simply does not hold up. The climate action plan states €9.5 billion from carbon tax will be ring-fenced for retrofitting, social welfare payments and agri-environmental projects. However, in reality there is a serious question mark over this funding and the actions to be funded by it. If the carbon tax is successful, receipts should be falling by the end of the decade and this is not taken into account. Second, and this is where the more serious issue arises, the EU Commission's Fit for 55 climate package proposes to take 70% to 80% of all carbon tax receipts into a central EU fund with Ireland as a net contributor. This leaves a black hole in the Government's finances and completely undermines the retrofitting targets and the promised social protection increases. As it stands, carbon tax will increase each year, all while Europe is positioning itself to siphon away the vast majority of it to redistribute it across Europe. This is a charge the Government has never addressed. Regardless, no level of carbon tax redistribution will address the immediate crisis. We need urgent and immediate action from the Government.  In recent weeks, my party leader, Deputy McDonald, asked the Taoiseach whether he would cut VAT on electricity over the winter months to provide households with some breathing space on utility bills. The Taoiseach had no answers on that day and has taken no action since. The Minister for Finance was similarly intransigent with my colleague, Deputy Doherty, when he raised the same issue last night. The figures we have received from the Department of Finance show the State collected €228 million in VAT on domestic electricity bills in 2020. How on earth can the Government stand over this, given the financial pressure workers and families are facing this year? The European Commission has said EU countries can reduce VAT and energy taxes, issue fuel vouchers, defer utility bills and ban grid disconnections to help families get through the winter months. While other EU countries have taken such action, the Irish Government has left Irish households to fend for themselves. It is a dereliction of duty and something that needs to change.  To get us out of this energy crisis the Government states we need a massive move away from fossil fuels towards renewables. For this we need a new grid. Today, EirGrid launched its Shaping Our Electricity Future plan, another glossy plan that states commitments to deliver essential grid capacity. It includes an outline of the key developments needed for networks, engagement, operations and market perspective to support a secure transition to at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030, in its words. I want to speak about engagement, particularly as it relates to the North-South interconnector. It is easy to write it on a page or say it is important but I do not believe EirGrid knows the meaning of it, unless ""engagement"" means predetermining outcome and driving through regardless; patronising local communities when they put forward reasonable and fair arguments; picking the information that suits its argument and ignoring other perspectives; or throwing taxpayers' money at sponsorship deals in a hopeless attempt to win over the people. In the most recent example, my local newspaper is reporting is a charge made by local communities in County Monaghan that EirGrid secretly intruded on the land of private landowners. There was no request made for access and no notice given. This is all at a time when a Government review of the project itself is under way. No one is holding out hope for the review because the terms of reference are so constrained. "
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	This is wide-ranging legislation. The transport committee undertook pre-legislative scrutiny over the past few months. Many aspects of the Bill seek to make our roads safer from variable speed limits to regulating e-scooters to giving gardaí more powers to check for uninsured vehicles on our roads. Sinn Féin welcomes these provisions. We support making our roads safer and trying to reduce the number of serious collisions and fatalities on our roads each year. The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, including tackling the dangerous use of scramblers, providing for the testing of autonomous vehicles on our roads, amending how fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens are dealt with and linking driver licence records with vehicle registration records. There is a huge amount in the Bill. Sinn Féin will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage which we think will improve the Bill and add positively to our road traffic legislation. I look forward to engaging with the Minister on that.  The popularity of e-scooters has accelerated in recent years, with a significant number of people now using them to commute to and from work and school. The rapid growth has bypassed current road traffic legislation and has left significant gaps in the law that need to be addressed. E-scooters are a cleaner, cheaper form of transport compared with cars and their use is only expected to grow. I welcome the efforts in this Bill to address their use on our roads. There is considerable detail on this and we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to unpack some of that. Introducing laws is not about punishing e-scooter users but, rather, putting protections in place for their safety and that of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.  A number of issues will need further discussion and interrogation when this Bill comes to Committee Stage, namely, the wearing of helmets and high-visibility clothing; the use of lights; areas where e-scooters can be used, including geofencing; liability; maximum speeds and power; and age limits. On Committee Stage, it will also be important to examine proposed e-scooter sharing schemes. These are commonplace across Europe and are hugely popular with tourists and residents alike. However, there is also concern over some of the negative aspects that can arise if a shared scheme is not introduced correctly. We do not want to see e-scooters used on footpaths or strewn all over sidewalks and public spaces, like we see in some cases elsewhere. This causes huge issues for people, particularly those with visual impairments, elderly people and people with a disability, as e-scooters can constitute serious hazards if they are not appropriately used or stored. It is, therefore, vital we develop appropriate pick-up and drop-off points for shared schemes. This will be an important issue to address on Committee Stage and I encourage the Minister of State to engage with groups such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland to hear their suggestions and to work with them to address their legitimate concerns and on the shape of the regulations that will follow.  E-bikes are another aspect of modern transport this Bill seeks to regulate for the first time. This is a positive initiative as it will help encourage this alternative form of mobility, reduce reliance on private cars and open opportunities for active and healthy travel for more people. I ask the Minister of State to advise the House whether she is considering expanding or reforming the bike-to-work scheme to take account of the growth of e-bikes and e-cargo bikes. As far as I am aware, €1,500 is the maximum cost that can be applied for the scheme, but some e-bikes and e-cargo bikes cost in excess of that. E-bikes cost a fraction of what an electric vehicle costs and take up much less room on our roads. While their regulation in this Bill is welcome, I hope the Government is planning to bring forward updated incentives to increase their use. The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard about the potential of e-bikes to make medium-distance travel more manageable for people.  On scramblers and quad bikes, Sinn Féin has consistently called for action and legislative reform to tackle the dangerous and illegal use of these bikes. My colleagues, Deputies Ellis, Munster and Paul Donnelly, brought forward legislation in this Dáil and the previous Dáil to regulate this area. Unfortunately, successive Governments have sat on their hands while communities continue to be tormented by their use. The misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in parks and public spaces, particularly in urban communities, is a significant problem. Many people feel frightened, unsafe and intimidated by the rogue use of these scrambler bikes in public areas, which should be shared spaces for everyone to enjoy safely. In addition, there have been very serious incidents, including relatively recently.  The Minister of State indicated the aim of these amendments is to ensure prosecutions for dangerous driving may be taken against those who use scramblers or other similar vehicles in a dangerous way in any location, altering the public space definition. We are also told the Bill seeks to strengthen the powers of An Garda Síochána when dealing with the illegal use of scramblers and quad bikes, including the explicit seizing of these bikes. It is imperative the provisions in this Bill are fit for purpose to finally address this problem. This is as much an issue for the Department of Justice as it is for the Department of Transport. The Minister for Justice and the Garda need to be involved in this. The most important step that must take place following the passing of this legislation is the implementation of these new laws by the Garda. We will seek a meeting with senior Garda management to ensure a strategy is put in place to enforce the laws and the Garda has the resources to do so.  Section 5(l) of this Bill amends section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which deals with traffic signs. We welcome this initiative, which will allow Transport Infrastructure Ireland to proceed with dynamic traffic management on the M50 in the first instance, giving it the power to change speed limits on sections of the network. Drivers will be notified of such changes via lane control signals along the road and on overhead gantries. The aim of this is to allow TII to close lanes temporarily and slow traffic approaching an area where there has been an accident or traffic build-up, in order to improve the dispersion of congestion and avoid further collisions.  Members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications visited TII’s operations centre in East Wall this week and saw at first hand the impressive work it does there monitoring the motorway network and keeping motorists safe. I echo the recommendation of the committee that Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Road Safety Authority run a public information campaign before the launch of the eMOS system on the M50 to ensure motorists are aware of the introduction and enforcement of variable speed limits and dynamic lane control. I note TII did that before it launched its early pilots. It is also important that the Department of Transport, TII and the RSA should monitor and analyse the report on the progress of the eMOS system on the M50 before proceeding with any further projects for other Irish motorways and I note the Minister of State's comments on that.  I briefly raise the High Court judgment from last week relating to driving licences. The judgment quashed a decision by the RSA which refused to exchange South African driving licences, citing residency issues as the applicants were in the direct provision system. The programme for Government contains a commitment to improve conditions for asylum seekers and specifically cites the ability to obtain a driving licence but this has still not been acted on. It is disappointing the applicants in this case were forced to take legal action in the first place but the successful outcome of their case is very welcome. I noted in a newspaper article at the weekend that a spokesperson for the Minister or the Department indicated an amendment to this legislation might be the place to address this matter. When does the Minister intend to address this judgment and what impact will that have on the wider driving licence system?  I am conscious that while the Minister for Transport was in Glasgow this week, hammering home the need to reduce emissions and get people on public transport, the NTA and the Government were announcing the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area which seemed to be on a completely different page. The provisions in the Bill set out a number of measures covering automatic vehicles, e-bikes and e-scooters. There are significant proposals and this Bill legislates for many aspects which align well with the direction of travel, for want of a better term, towards the type transport of infrastructure and model we will have in the future. However, much of what we saw yesterday in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, many of the provisions in the national development plan and the level of funding for Connecting Ireland, for example, do the opposite. I note the plan moves away from the Navan rail line and MetroLink projects and puts light rail on the long finger and heavy rail on a longer finger. There is a mismatch between the rhetoric and the policy and, certainly, the delivery. That needs to be addressed in the time ahead.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Science Week 2021: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. I thank the Business Committee for scheduling it and Deputy Naughten who was involved in ensuring that was the case. I commend Deputy Naughten on his chairmanship of the Houses of the Oireachtas Friends of Science group, of which I am a member. I do not get to it as much as I might like, but it is a very useful forum.  There is a huge opportunity for Ireland in science, research and innovation. There are opportunities in the green, digital, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. I would like to see the State take a leading role in creating the environment for progress. I welcome the establishment of the Department. I do not think we are there yet with the Department. I have submitted parliamentary questions asking the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science what efforts the Minister is making to position Ireland as a world leader in renewable energy, research and development. It is a reasonable question. It was diverted to another Department. Everyone in this Chamber knows what happens if one’s question does not meet that standard and it is diverted elsewhere, it tells you something about the question you are asking or the Department's interest in responding to it. I encourage the Department to take on a cross-cutting role in research, innovation and to set the bar high.   I want to make a point on our working scientists in Ireland. I was one before in a previous life. Yesterday we heard that medical scientists voted for industrial action up to and including strike action. That is a very significant move. My colleague Deputy Louise O’Reilly also mentioned this. This group has taken this step only once in the past 60 years. It seeks pay parity with biochemist colleagues, colleagues who do the same work but are paid more. They are an excellent example of Irish science research, innovation and potential but that potential is being denied and is being lost due to the intransigence of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health. That needs to change. I find the whole thing incredible. We have brilliantly trained scientists, experts, a wealth of knowledge, a tremendous asset and resource to our State and to science and innovation, and instead of saying “Yes, let us realise the potential of this and maximise the benefit for the public good, for science and for innovation”, the State is saying “No, there is a glass ceiling and you will go no further”. It has built in a punitive level of inequality. The State is cutting its nose to spite its face and losing credibility and good people at the same time. I implore the Minister of State to take back that to his colleagues in government, to get around the table and get it resolved. It is a 20-year-old agreement that has not been delivered on.   In the coming weeks, I will bring forward legislation not dissimilar to a Bill the Minister of State’s former colleague, former Deputy Billy Kelleher, brought forward on the transfer of value and payments from the pharmaceutical industry to healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations. It is an important thing to do. We want to be proactive and create an environment where industry works with the public sector, third level and communities. We saw this with the Creating our Future initiative, which is very welcome but there needs to be transparency and accountability and a public return on a public good. I ask that the Government would engage with that transparency legislation when I bring it forward in the coming weeks. It would be for the betterment of scientific endeavour in this country. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-17 09:10:00+00:00	National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	1	"I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this Bill. It seeks to amend the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996 in order to ""confer functions on the [NSAI] in relation to promoting the use of standard specifications and standard marks to give information about the carbon footprint of commodities, process and practices"". Sinn Féin will support the Bill.  It is important now and will be increasingly so into the future that we have such mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability. We have heard speakers from the Labour Party and they agree the Bill will not crack that nut but is a step in the right direction and can be built upon. There are questions in terms of how we operationalise such a system of accounting but it will be important, not least because we already see how some large corporations are bombarding consumers with more and more dubious claims about their green credentials.  My colleague, Senator Boylan, has highlighted how several energy suppliers that claim to offer electricity from 100% renewable sources are simultaneously raising their prices during this period of extortionate gas prices on the international markets. That raises the question of how companies who are supposedly 100% renewable are so exposed to the volatility in the gas market. At least part of the answer relates to the fact they are not 100% renewable, but by marketing manoeuvre and advertising sleight of hand, they present it as such. When a person signs up to a 100% renewable supplier, he or she is probably expecting the electricity will be generated by wind, solar or hydropower but, in many cases, 100% renewable involves suppliers getting electricity from whatever fossil fuel source they like and buying certificates to offset the non-renewable electricity, so-called guarantees of origin. One guarantee of origin corresponds to 1 MWh of renewable electricity. It is a financial document. If a supplier wants 100% renewable electricity, it buys from a producer that offers the guarantees alongside the sales. An energy supplier offering 100% renewable can buy the guarantees from anywhere in Europe but the electricity delivered will still most likely come from fossil fuel power plants in Ireland or on the Continent. For example, a consumer on a 100% renewable tariff could be getting coal-fired power from Moneypoint. On paper, it reads as 100% renewable because the supplier has bought guarantees, but it is not. This practice is damaging because people have a right to know where their energy is coming from. If people want to avoid fossil fuels, there is no way of knowing which energy companies do not use them.  Several of the 18 suppliers that had their fuel mixes disclosed this week by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, claimed to be 100% renewable but this is not the case. Customers are being misled and this needs to be addressed. This is one example, but greenwashing, as has already been referenced, is bad and getting worse. While this Bill seeks to appoint the NSAI to provide independent and comparable figures that include corporate processes and practices in recognisable and reliable standard measures, we also need tighter advertising standards to ensure companies cannot make outlandish climate claims, green claims or greenwashing claims without rigorous oversight and verification. This stuff really does matter. The current advertising standards are not robust enough.  Elsewhere, the Bill seeks to introduce carbon footprint information on all products. The aim of this would be to provide consumers with information about the environmental impacts of products, in a similar vein to how ingredients or calories are presented on products. Some companies already do this voluntarily. For example, Quorn, the meat alternative company has carbon labelling on some products, and BrewDog, the brewery, pub and restaurant chain, highlights the carbon footprint of individual items on its menu. The widespread use and standardisation of such an approach would provide for improved tracing, transparency, accountability and better information for consumers, remembering the old maxim to the effect that if you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it. It should not simply be seen as a tool to influence consumer behaviour. That is an important point and I do not think that is the suggestion from the proposers.   We are in a climate crisis. We need to address the root causes of the crisis and we need systems change in energy, transport, economics and food. While individuals can and will play their part, the focus should not be diverted from the major corporations that are responsible for huge amounts of emissions or from the failure of successive governments to take appropriate action and lead from the front to stem the impact of climate change. The climate crisis will not be tackled by shifting the focus onto individual behaviours or individual consumer choices. Carbon labelling can be for the climate crisis what calorific labelling is for the obesity epidemic. It can be a waste of time, an irrelevance, or worse, a tool to be used to give the semblance of action as powerful corporations drive on, ever more rampant and reckless. Other forces at play, such as predatory advertising, need to be tackled. Tighter regulation and proper deterrents are needed in tandem with providing consumers with more information if we are to tackle this issue successfully.  We need to recognise the disproportionate contribution of the world's wealthiest on the climate emergency. Last week, the CEO of Amazon waxed lyrical about climate change at COP26. With no shame, the same man took a vanity trip to space a few weeks before. He did not mention that or the fact that a few miles up the road from Glasgow in Dunfermline, Amazon was found to be in the practice of destroying millions of items in unsold stock every year, including smart TVs, laptops, drones and hairdryers. Let us not talk about product obsolescence. I welcome the moves the Government is making in relation to the circular economy and that needs to happen as quickly as possible.   Oxfam's report on confronting carbon inequality highlights the fact that during a critical 25-year period of unprecedented emissions growth, the richest 1% of the world's population were responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorer half of humanity. Ordinary people would be correct in thinking there is one rule for them and one for the wealthy when it comes to climate action. We will not successfully tackle the climate crisis with a business as usual,  One area where the State is outsourcing its obligations is offshore wind. We have almost unlimited potential for green offshore winds but the slow pace of planning and regulation is putting off some investors and the State is not leading from the front. Sinn Féin acknowledged the role of private companies in the development of offshore wind but we want to see semi-State bodies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna invest, develop and, importantly, retain ownership of renewable energy projects. It is essential the State does not become as reliant on private renewable energy production as it is on fossil fuels energy production now. The constant energy price hikes demonstrate how dependent and exposed the State is to volatility in the international energy markets and highlight the need to eliminate this threat.   I welcome the legislation and note the Government's amendment. It is an approach the Government has used consistently. It buys a year. I urge that action take place. We are in the middle of a climate emergency and need to see action. I am concerned in another respect. There is lots that could be done at European level. Some of what this Bill could deliver is, for example, an assessment of the carbon labelling of mushrooms grown on Irish peat versus international horticultural peat. Similarly, there is the comparison between Irish beef and Brazilian beef.  That is an important contribution it could make. The European Union also has a responsibility in terms of the Mercosur deal and international trade deals. It needs to watch its own carbon footprint as well.  I also want to make reference to young people, who are ahead of us in this regard. At the last Young Scientist competition I attended, a local school from my own area, Eureka Secondary School, put forward proposals in line with this. We need to get on board with that."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-17 09:10:00+00:00	Air Accident Investigation Unit Final Report into R116 air accident: Statements	1	"At the outset I join the Minister and colleagues across the House in expressing my deepest sympathies and those of my party to the families, friends and colleagues of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smith and winch operator Paul Ormsby. The crew of R116 epitomised the courage, bravery, selflessness and dedication to the welfare of others that are the hallmark of members and volunteers of the Irish Coast Guard and our emergency services. Today we remember them. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse.  The extensive final report on the crash of the R116 helicopter in March 2017 was published by the AAIU earlier this month. It included detailed findings and recommendations. I thank the members of the AAIU for their vital work in investigating this incident and preparing this report. I welcome the comments from the Minister for Transport that he fully accepts the recommendations contained in the report. However, accepting these recommendations is not enough and I would like the Minister to outline a timeline for when each of the 42 safety recommendations will be fully addressed and implemented.  As colleagues have said, the Minister's statement was a very detailed one and will take time to consider. Noting that the safety recommendations relate to several parties such as the IAA, CHC Ireland, the Department itself, the Sikorsky Aircraft corporation, the European Commission and EASA, how does the Minister intend to ensure each party responds and acts appropriately to the recommendations that apply to it? What mechanism will be put in place to ensure that happens on a co-ordinated basis? Some people have suggested a co-chaired working group model or a stakeholder forum. I would be interested to hear the Minister's perspective.  It is essential that each of the recommendations is acted on with haste to ensure everything is done to try to prevent another such tragedy. A deadline should be set for departmental officials or the Minister to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to report on the full implementation of the 42 safety recommendations. I know significant detail was given to the House tonight, but it would be appropriate to submit that information to the committee and to have it line up against the 42 recommendations. I would welcome the Minister's opinion on this approach.  The AAIU detailed 71 findings in the conclusion of its report. These findings raise serious questions for the State, its agencies and the operator. For example, contributory cause No. 12 identified that there was confusion at State level regarding responsibility for oversight of SAR operations in Ireland. The Minister referred to this in his contribution.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill, which seeks to significantly redesign air navigation services in the State, is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad. Is the Minister satisfied the confusion regarding responsibility for oversight of SAR operations in Ireland has now been fully resolved? Are any changes needed to the Bill to make this key responsibility more explicit?  Regarding the maps, charts and imagery available to the crew on the night, the report found that Black Rock was not in the enhanced ground proximity warning system, EGPWS, databases; the 1:250,000 aeronautical chart, Euronav, imagery did not extend as far as Black Rock; and the 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey of Ireland, OSI, imagery available on the Toughbook did not show Black Rock Lighthouse or terrain and appeared to show open water in the vicinity of Black Rock. Even to an ordinary person reading this report, these findings are striking and pose sobering questions about the aeronautical data available to the crew of R116 on the night.  The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has been in contact with the Minister about the role of the IAA in overseeing the provision of accurate charts and aeronautical data as set out by ICAO obligations. IALPA has stated that the crew “relied on the data production standards of Irish regulation to guarantee them correct information. They were let down.” It is hard to disagree with that assessment on reading the report.  Raising concerns some time beforehand on 26 June 2013, one of the operator’s pilots emailed several other personnel, advising that the Blacksod south route had been flown the previous night and it was noticed that Black Rock Lighthouse was not shown on the EGPWS. The pilot stated that at 310 ft. high, the lighthouse was an obvious hazard and suggested that although it was mentioned in the route notes, the EGPWS issue should be highlighted as well. The following day, on 27 June, a different pilot emailed several of the same personnel, advising that Inishmurray and Black Rock were not contained in the EGPWS databases.  The next day, on 28 June, one of the operator’s pilots emailed the EGPWS manufacturer advising that: ""a few Islands and lighthouses locally... do not appear on the database. Is it possible to get these obstructions added to the database? If so, how do we go about it?"" The manufacturer replied stating it would examine the matter. The manufacturer later told investigators that it could not find any evidence it had been provided with “specific actionable data on what islands and lighthouses to add”, and the matter was regrettably closed in March 2015 with no action taken. It is devastating to read that concern about this critical information was raised four years before the R116 crash, but no action was taken to address it. I hope new processes have been put in place to ensure critical pieces of information about mapping errors are acted upon and addressed with appropriate urgency when they are identified.  The crew were provided with a low-level approach chart that started right above a fatal hazard. That hazard, Black Rock Island, was not adequately highlighted on charts and the charts had no vertical profile to provide crew with safe crossing heights. The crew had not been trained on all specific approaches on simulators and did not have ""prescribed recent experience"" of different landing sites.  In response to the AAIU report, the family of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick said that while there is a weighty responsibility on the operator to minimise the risk to the crew, this was not done on this occasion. They said they believed the crew members of R116 were badly let down by the operator not providing them with the safe operating procedures and training that they were entitled to expect.  It is impossible to read the report without thinking that many opportunities to mitigate risk were missed and wondering if the tragedy on the morning of 14 March 2017 would have been avoided if instead of being missed, corrective and preventative actions had been realised. What might have happened if the systems of operation, training, support and oversight were to the standard required?  Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smith and winch operator Paul Ormsby gave their lives in the courageous pursuit of protecting others. Nothing we say here will turn back time or ease the pain for their loved ones. The report from the AAIU provides the basis for ensuring that lessons are learned and acted on. It is an opportunity that should not be missed."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-24 09:10:00+00:00	Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The importance of the State's accident investigative units was highlighted in recent weeks with the publication of the final report into the R116 crash off the Mayo coast in 2017, which was a report and investigation conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU. This report laid out the extensive investigation carried out by the AAIU and made 42 safety recommendations to a number of parties, aimed at trying to prevent another terrible tragedy. The AAIU has responsibility for aviation accidents, while the Railway Accident Investigation Unit has responsibility for incidents on our railways and the equivalent for our vast maritime area is the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The MCIB was established in March 2003 under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000. In 2019, the MCIB commenced full investigations into ten separate incidents, which was double the number investigated in 2018. This included accidents at sea, in recreational fishing, kayaking and in the cargo shipping area. Three sinkings, six fatalities and one injury were also investigated by the MCIB in 2019. Its work is vital and I commend the investigators, the secretariat and the board on their essential work. I am, however, deeply concerned that the MCIB is not appropriately structured or resourced by the Government to a level commensurate with its degree of responsibility.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks heard evidence earlier this year that what we need for the maritime sector is an independent investigative unit headed by a full-time principal investigator, with full-time assistance from qualified maritime professionals, in line with what is currently in place for the aviation and rail sectors. That makes complete sense. Unfortunately, that provision is not in this Bill. This Bill, as the Minister of State has mentioned, is urgently needed in order to fill vacancies left at the MCIB as a result of a European court ruling last year. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union found that the composition of the MCIB was not adhering to EU regulations against potential conflicts of interest. Specifically, this concerned the chief surveyor and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, or their nominees, who were members of the board. Their membership could have been a conflict of interest, as the Department of Transport could be a party to any MCIB investigation. The two board members in question resigned their positions in the aftermath of the judgment and the board now comprises three members, with no process to fill the vacancies. This Bill will allow for the appointment of new board members, with a minimum of five and maximum of seven on the MCIB. While I welcome the ability of the board to gain new members and function effectively, this is just a sticking plaster when we consider what is needed, which is overall reform.   As mentioned, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks heard evidence on the need to reform and beef up the MCIB. I thank Mr. Michael Kingston and Mr. Ciaran McCarthy, who appeared as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process on this Bill in early 2021 and provided helpful assistance to members of the committee. In his evidence to us, Mr. Kingston highlighted the financial disparity with the other two investigative units, namely, the AAIU and the Railway Accident Investigation Unit. In 2019, the MCIB spent €27,000 on investigators in the field for ten incidents, including, tragically, six deaths in the maritime sector. A total of €750,000 was spent on aviation and €350,000 was spent on rail. These are the amounts spent on investigators in the field, leaving aside spending on administrative staff. This gap in funding highlights the significant difference in approach. Again, I do not wish to criticise the individuals working at the MCIB but we need comprehensive reform and proper resourcing to bring it into line with the two equivalent accident investigative units.  The function of the MCIB is to examine and carry out investigations into all types of marine casualties to, or on board, Irish registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways. Ireland’s maritime area is seven times the size of its landmass, with 7,500 km of coastline, not to mention our inland waterways. It is a vast area with complex and often dangerous vessel movements and we need a fully resourced investigative unit to match this.   Brexit has resulted in a huge increase in the number of direct shipping routes to the Continent, which is welcome. There are now 44 direct ferry routes between Ireland, France and the Benelux countries, up from just seven before Brexit. While thankfully we do not see many accidents in this area, it is a significant increase in the number of vessels, vehicles and personnel using our ports and taking longer journeys at sea, which will undoubtedly give rise to the potential for an increase in accidents. In addition, it is the State’s ambition to develop 5 GW of offshore wind power over the next decade. This will see a huge increase in activity at our ports and construction in our seas to build the offshore wind turbines. Again, this will result in a significant increase in vessel and personnel movements and more complex operations to install the turbines offshore. I am not suggesting this cannot be done safely but with such a major increase in activity in this area, it is absolutely appropriate to have a fully funded and adequately resourced maritime investigative unit to try to reduce the number of potential incidents and ensure that any accidents are investigated and learned from quickly.  The need for codification of marine law has also been highlighted previously but this Bill does not do that. The Bill refers to Merchant Shipping Acts going back as far as 1894. Some of this law was drafted before the State came into existence and when the merchant shipping fleet would have been largely sailing ships, not even steamships, not to mention the diesel ships that we have today. It is very difficult for stakeholders to untangle the complex web and find out what is required of them, which can only have a highly negative impact on compliance. It is clear this area is crying out for codification but the Government has said it will get back to it later as it needs to progress this particular Bill quickly.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Oireachtas committee stated that it welcomed the commencement of the Department’s review of our national marine investigation framework and looked forward to receiving a copy of the Clinch report as soon as possible. When will we see that report? We are very anxious to see it. The Minister of State referenced it in her opening remarks. It is important that committee members see it in advance of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill during which we will want to submit various amendments.   Sinn Féin recognises that this is important, technical legislation but as it is presented, it is a missed opportunity. It should have gone further and addressed the fundamental weaknesses, outside of the structural pieces, in the MCIB. We acknowledge that the Clinch report is complete and that we have a tentative commitment from the Government to consider legislation in the time ahead but we need to see more. We will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage that will enshrine that commitment in this legislation. I look forward to working with the Minister of State, members of the committee and other Members across this House to improve this legislation. It is necessary legislation and the measures provided thus far are necessary in terms of compliance with European law but we have a long way to go to deliver an investigative framework and system that is fit for purpose.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-02 09:10:00+00:00	Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill 2022: First Stage	1	"I move: That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to require pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment suppliers and their servants or agents, to declare payments, gifts, donations or other transfers of values provided to healthcare professionals or health care organisations on an annual basis. I am happy to introduce the Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill with my colleagues, Deputies Cullinane and Seán Crowe. We know that payments to healthcare professionals and organisations can create conflicts of interest. Evidence shows that receipt of payments from the pharmaceutical industry, for example, is associated with higher prescribing rates, higher prescribing costs, increased use of specific drug classes, including opioids, and lower prescribing quality, with consequent impact on health outcomes and, in public health systems, on the public purse. The popular programme ""Dopesick"" highlighted an extreme case to great effect in the context of the opioid epidemic in the United States. In Ireland, tens of millions of euro are paid to healthcare professionals and organisations each year by the pharmaceutical industry. While a voluntary register of these payments is currently in place, recent research conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland found that the identity of many recipients is anonymous, while other payments may not be reported at all. Payments from medical equipment suppliers or medical device companies are also excluded.  The current voluntary system is inadequate. It is not fit for purpose. The Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill is needed to bring Ireland in line with international best practice and is a measure in the interest of professionals, organisations and the general public. This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment suppliers to declare all payments to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, on an annual basis and provides for penalties for failure to do so. The Bill also provides for the HPRA to establish and maintain the register and to ensure it is searchable and accessible to the public. Such a system will enhance transparency, public trust and ethical standards, while providing a regulated environment for productive collaboration. I commend the Bill to the House."

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. People are facing real hardship in their day-to-day lives with inflation and runaway living costs The Government has sat on its hands and allowed the cost-of-living crisis to grow, and indeed it has contributed to it. Rents have been spiralling out of control for years and the Government has done nothing. The Government has failed to address high childcare costs for parents and inflation is outpacing wage growth to no end. Each year the Government hikes tax on energy and then wonders why people are struggling to heat their homes. These policy failures are now coming together into a crippling cost-of-living crisis. The Government is completely out of touch with reality and is either unwilling or unable to take the necessary action to tackle the costs that are having a detrimental impact on workers and families across the State.  Of course the €100 electricity discount is welcome, but it will not make a dent in the financial challenge households are facing. It does not go far enough. Everyone knows that, including apparently the Government, if leaks from parliamentary party meetings in morning news reports are anything to go by. The Tánaiste acknowledged as much on Leaders' Questions earlier. Budget 2022 did not go far enough to protect people. The Government says it is making plans to do something about it. There has been talk from the Government to the effect of ""If we knew then what we know now"", but the truth is the Government did know then what it knows now because Sinn Féin and many others were shouting it from the rooftops. I raised it with the Minister of State three times in the previous term alone on Priority Questions, starting in July. Sinn Féin's alternative budget set out enhanced payments in social welfare, fuel allowance and a utility debt discretionary fund. The Government failed to heed any of it. The EU introduced its toolkit in October in recognition of the crisis and giving a green light to do something about it. Two months later, in the days before Christmas, the Government said it had a plan. Here we are on 3 February hoping that people might get grace to the value of €100 in a month or two. Families are in crisis and it is deepening one. When someone sounds the alarm in October you do not respond by saying I will see you in March or April. We know that inflation hits the poorest hardest and that the CSO's data are not reflective of this. We do not have accurate data on fuel poverty because this Government and that which preceded it failed to design measures for it. Anyone who bothers to listen knows that families have been put to the pin of their collars and beyond. They are in crisis and this Government knowingly delayed action. The €100 is welcome but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Much more needs to be done to help people. This Bill, if suitably amended, can act as a start, albeit a very late one.  We in Sinn Féin are not happy with the current draft of the Bill and we have submitted numerous amendments for consideration on Committee Stage. In the first instance, we are concerned that this Bill is drafted in such a way as to permit only one payment. That does not reflect the crisis we are in. A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done. There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon. With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year. Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly.  We also want to see the Minister target these payments to households who need it most. The lack of targeting is a major weakness. This Bill is a very blunt instrument that will see millions of euro transferred to individuals who, relatively speaking, have no financial worries. It will see millionaires and others who do not need financial help get €100 from the taxpayer, while those who really need extra help will, in real and relative terms, still be below the water. We would like to see provision for those who want to forgo the payment have the option of surrendering their payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty. It is far from an ideal approach, but it is an attempt to make this legislation better, by trying to direct payments to those most in need.  We believe holiday homes should be excluded. We cannot have a situation where a person who is lucky enough to own two homes gets €200 while a family living on the breadline can only access half that amount.  I welcome some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, but we believe protection is needed for renters in this Bill. Some tenants' energy bills are managed by their landlord or a property management company. We do not want to see a situation where the credit is applied to bills but the savings are not passed on to the tenant. Sinn Féin has put forward an amendment seeking to ensure the €100 payment is passed on to renters and providing for a right to access a dispute mechanism.  On a related point, I draw the Minister of State's attention to the issue of Travellers' access to the €100 credit. Will the Minister outline how this credit will apply to Travellers living on halting sites? The local authorities are the electricity account holder in many cases and families make payments to their local authorities. Perhaps the Minister of State will revert to me on that later.  Sinn Féin calls on the Minister of State to engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the level of need for assistance with heating and electricity costs it is experiencing to ascertain the need for a discretionary fund to assist those in utility debt and target those who need additional support most. We called for such a discretionary fund in budget 2022 in addition to proposing to allocate €30 million to extend the fuel allowance eligibility. Like other positive proposals, however, it was not taken on board.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate. I encourage the Minister of State and Department to take on board Opposition proposals. There is an opportunity to improve on the legislation. Sinn Féin will put forward constructive amendments, as will others in the Opposition. The Minister of State and Department should take them on board."

I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Bill, along with my colleagues Deputies Réada Cronin, Johnny Guirke and Maurice Quinlivan. Hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources through electrolysis of water is emerging as a sustainable solution for the decarbonisation of many sectors. It has, for example, the potential to act as a store of surplus renewable energy, an alternative source of heat for homes and businesses and an alternative source of fuel in the transport sector, including for long-haul and heavy goods vehicles, HGVs. In the words of Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, in response to me in a recent Oireachtas committee meeting, there is a lot of talk about hydrogen at the moment but perhaps not enough strategic planning around it. We need a plan and we need to get the picture on the page so that we can see what it looks like. This Bill calls on the Minister to publish a green hydrogen strategy within six months of its passing and sets out the framework for that strategy. It is an important and necessary step.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-09 09:10:00+00:00	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	1	I move amendment No. 3: In page 4, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following: “(e) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to identify those who own holiday homes or multiple properties and put in place a mechanism to ensure such individuals do not receive more than one electricity costs emergency benefit payments. (f) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to identify those who are renting, to ensure renters receive the benefit of the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, and the Minister shall put in place a dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any disputes between renters and their landlords or property management companies over the electricity costs emergency benefit payment. (g) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to ensure those who do not need the financial support from the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, can inform their electricity supplier to redirect their electricity costs emergency benefit payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty.”. I will speak to the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Pearse Doherty. The amendment seeks to address a number of weaknesses in the Bill. A number of amendments that were ruled out of order for various reasons also sought to improve the legislation.  This amendment seeks to deal with three issues, the first of which is the prospect of the payment being made to people who have holiday homes with potentially very little electricity use. These houses would only be used for some weeks of the year. The amendment also applies to people with multiple properties who would be in a position to receive multiple payments for their properties. At the very least, such situations do not reflect their electricity or energy use and the cost to them of electricity. This anomaly should be addressed, especially when considered in the context of the potential risk that people who are house sharing and splitting bills or whose names are not on the bill will miss out on this payment. Paragraph (f) of the amendment provides that renters would receive the benefit of the payment.  We call for a dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place. The Minister, in his Second Stage speech, indicated that such a provision will be made. When this payment is triggered, which is not happening nearly quickly enough, we need to ensure that those who are entitled to it get the benefit of it.  Paragraph (g) addresses a fundamental weakness of the measure, namely, its universal nature. It is not targeted. While the Government has made its case on that, it is a fundamental weakness. Despite other measures the Government has introduced, many people will still be below the waterline, even with this €100 payment. We are incredibly frustrated that the Government did not go further or take action earlier and that it has taken this long to reach this juncture. We set out in our pre-budget submission, and will set out in the days ahead, the course the Government should take. A fundamental part of that is a response that is reflective of the burden on individuals and families. We do not see that in the legislation. Paragraph (g) gives all those who do not need this support, including every Member of this House, an opportunity to forgo the payment and redirect towards charities working in the area of energy poverty.  The amendment would strengthen the Bill. Of the 11 amendments we submitted, ten have been ruled out of order. They also would have strengthened the Bill. I ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to support the amendment and take on board the contributions made on Second Stage by Deputies from across the political spectrum, particularly the Opposition, pointing out the weakness of this Bill. I appreciate that there are constraints on the Government with regard to the targeting of this measure but those constraints were self-inflicted by the Government. It has not done the work over the years to identify those living in energy poverty and at risk of energy poverty. There is no sophistication in the architecture of the State, including Department, to direct those resources in the way they should be directed. This is down to a lack of preparation.  The Government has indicated it will make proposals which, while not a mini-budget, will address the costs of living. I ask that the weaknesses of the Bill be addressed in the suite of measures that are brought forward. Sinn Féin would be more than happy to advise in that regard.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-16 09:10:00+00:00	Mobility and Transport Supports for People with Disabilities: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I thank the Regional Group for bringing it forward. It is a motion about inclusion and ensuring the right to mobility and the associated independence for people with disabilities, and ensuring that people with disabilities can live full and active lives in our communities. The motion is welcome and necessary, and it should be supported. Government policy under successive governments has failed to deliver. It has failed people with disabilities and impeded them.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, we heard from representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind about the forthcoming road traffic Bill and about broader issues relating to access to transport. The witnesses spoke about the importance of the primary medical certificate. They pointed to the fact that the mobility allowance and the transport grant were stopped nearly a decade ago and have not returned. They pointed to the broad suite of issues that continue to impede. On the primary medical certificate they said: ""A review is required of the primary medical certificate. It is as simple as that. The sooner it can get under way, the better.""  They also argued that the certificate should be extended to include people with intellectual disabilities or autism, people who in the severe category will definitely never hold independent employment. They said: ""They definitely need preferential parking for ease of access for their carers and themselves"". Similarly, they pointed to the fact that blindness is not regarded as a qualifying criterion for the primary medical certificate, so a review of that is required. In addition, they pointed to the cases of people who are too visually impaired to drive but are not registered as blind and, as a result, are excluded from free travel. That speaks to the failure of Government policy to respond to the needs of people with disabilities. There are hundreds of people in this category but, like for so many people with a disability, the computer says ""No"". There is no accommodation, understanding or common sense in the current systems and, as a result, people are excluded, disadvantaged and isolated. The primary medical certificate is only one aspect of this issue. We need to replace the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant. We need universal design of buses, trains, taxis and associated infrastructure. We need public transport in the right place and at the right time that is accessible, available and affordable. The same goes for streetscapes. We need a full suite of supports to empower people and ensure they can travel independently. It should not be an afterthought, as it is, at best, in many cases currently. Rather, it should be built into everything we do - literally and figuratively."

We have articulated the position repeatedly over recent months and days. I am disappointed that our amendments have been ruled out of order, but so be it. I am more disappointed that the Minister did not table similar amendments. We firmly believe that now is the opportunity to get the area of marine casualty investigations right. There is a long and sorry history of missed opportunities, whether it be in the 1998 report, the 2010 Róisín Lacey report, or the 2020 Clinch report. We have the Róisín Lacey report. It explains clearly what needed and needs to be done. Instead, the State defended the indefensible at a European court and, as expected, failed.  We have deep concerns about the fact the Bill does not go further. As I said on Committee Stage, we hear the commitments from the Minister to publish the Clinch report at the end of the first quarter. There is a big question mark over that. It is subject to approval by the Attorney General. There is a further commitment to deliver the substantive legislation that has been called for across the political spectrum. Again, there is a huge question mark over that in its being subject to approval by Cabinet.  There are clear weaknesses in marine casualty investigation in Ireland. This was the legislation that could have resolved it. We had 18 months to get it right but the Minister has not got it right and has not taken the opportunity to give cast-iron guarantees in this legislation that, within a given timeframe, he would deliver the necessary reforms. In that context, we cannot support the Bill.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-02 09:10:00+00:00	National Driver Licence Service: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion and I thank Deputy McNamara and the Independent Group for tabling it. Sinn Féin supports the motion, which raises some very important issues, particularly as they relate to inclusivity, State procurement and State priorities.  Two weeks ago, in a response to a parliamentary question I tabled, and again today, the Minister has confirmed that the current NDLS contract, which was put in place with the front-office service provider in June 2021, no longer offers a walk-in service. Appointments must be booked to attend an NDLS centre and are made available through the online booking system or by telephone. The fact is that the current system is failing people. I will share with the House the experience of one constituent of mine who went to his local NDLS centre on 8 February. He arrived for an appointment only to realise that he had not received an email - he does not have email - or a text confirmation so had no appointment. The centre was empty, however, so he immediately rang 0818 919 090. He received no response. He dialled 1 - no response. He dialled 9 - no response. The official behind the desk told him he was wasting his time. He went home. He tried to reach the service on that number for 20 minutes on each of the next four days. He received no response. On day five he waited 101 minutes before his call was answered.  To add insult to injury, this service has been outsourced to a private company with a limited footprint, 34 offices, at a time when this Government and that which preceded it have known full well that An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union are crying out for this type of contract to ensure their future viability. If they were before us today, they would say that they want more Government services and footfall, particularly any work that requires ID verification. They already do that work for the Department of Social Protection. In hundreds of post offices they already have ID verification equipment and systems and, at the drop of a hat, they could have such equipment in every single office if that was what was required.  The truth, however, is that the post office network is hanging in the balance, and successive Governments have continued to turn their backs on the network. This is despite the fact that the 2016 Kerr report on the future of the post office network, on page 41, highlighted specifically that the provision of driver licences should be considered as part of an increase in the range of Government services available through the post office network.  In March of last year, the Government set up an offline services group to identify suitable services based on the recommendations of the offline services report and to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to post offices. We were told that this group, in conducting its work, was considering the increased use of the post office network for the delivery of Government services. On 7 July of last year, during a Dáil debate on the post office network, the Minister of State said: ""The Government's objectives for An Post include harnessing the opportunities presented by e-commerce and the digital economy, capturing and retaining market share in parcels and delivering a sustainable nationwide post office network offering a range of e-commerce, financial and Government services."" I stress the phrase ""and Government services"". What has come of all that? What Government services have been or will be transferred to An Post since these groups and objectives were identified? What has come of the Government's explorations and examinations? Following report after report, nothing has come of this from the perspective of An Post. There are comforting words from the Government but, when it comes to it, when there are clear options on the table, An Post loses out. There might be some small defence if the Government said it was delivering a better service at a cheaper rate, but the exact opposite is true in the case of the driver licence service.  To add further insult to further injury, as for the online service, the Government looks set to throw good money after bad in defence of the PSC. That is what I expect the Government will do, as other Deputies have said, if it does not remove the PSC requirement. To be clear, the objective is to drive people online, and it is 100% mandatory to have a PSC to avail of services online. That is belligerence. The Government needs to act on this and remove that element."

This is one occasion where we welcome the Government amendments. Sinn Féin had put forward a series of amendments on both Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil that, I firmly believe, would have given the Government greater flexibility regarding the upper limits and would have meant we would not need primary legislation if we were to return to similar circumstances in the near, or even not-so-near, future.  I have had a series of meetings in recent days with representatives of energy suppliers. They are very concerned with the current state of affairs and, obviously, everything happening in Ukraine impacts on that. Of course, energy costs are not our primary consideration in that regard, but increases are likely to be a very real consequence. We are, quite possibly, facing into a summer and winter this year that will realise the same types of energy cost increases that we saw last year, and that will put families beyond the pin of their collar. It will drive families into energy and fuel poverty, and into poverty in general, and I expect we will again end up in this position, needing the Government to deliver a significant package of support.  At this point, the proposals from the Government do not go far enough, although the provisions in the legislation are welcome. The Government has constrained itself through how it has framed the legislation, and the Sinn Féin amendments would have given the Government more flexibility. Regrettably, I firmly believe we will be back here again, on our part calling on the Government to do more and presenting alternative options to the Government to do more to protect families from the impact of rising fuel and energy costs. I do not say with any degree of satisfaction that what we are facing into in the months ahead is deeply concerning. As I said, I have met stakeholders from across the spectrum. They say they are weeks away from significant price hikes and they are looking towards the back end of the year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows this well and I am sure he has been having similar conversations. He has heard our criticism of the legislation but we will nonetheless support it. I implore the Government to see the writing on the wall, look to the months ahead and the summer and the winter, and get its act together by coming back with a substantial proposal to mitigate the impacts these unfortunate and regrettable increases will have on families.

Energia, SSE Airtricity and the ESB are three examples. It is reported ESB will report record profits of €679 million for 2021, up 10% on 2020. To give some perspective, the Government's cost-of-living package was €505 million.  The European Commission is very clear and it has spelt out how governments can, and should, assess and tackle excessive crisis-related windfall profits. Does the Government believe these profits at ESB and elsewhere are excessive? How is the matter being assessed? Is the Government considering introducing a windfall tax?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-09 09:10:00+00:00	Financial Resolution: Excise	1	This Government response is totally inadequate and insufficient. In the short time I have available to me, I want to make the case on behalf of the transport and logistics sector, the sector that keeps supply lines open and people and goods moving. It includes hauliers, private coach operators, school bus operators, coach tourism operators and taxi drivers. Businesses from the four corners of the State have been in contact with me in recent days crying out for support. A haulier in my county who has been drawing fresh food and vegetables for more than 25 years says he will finish up at the end of this week because fuel is beyond €1.70 per litre plus VAT, with promises of further increases. He uses 78,000 l per month but bases his prices on a cost of 95 cent per litre plus VAT. He cannot take it. He cannot pass the cost on to his customers and has no fuel surcharge. If more is not done on diesel prices, he will go to the wall. His business is family run and has 25 lorries and 40 employees.  Similarly, as of this week, a school bus operator in north Dublin is running at a loss. He signed a five-year contract with Bus Éireann in 2018 based on a cost of €1.37 per litre. Prices are now beyond €1.70 per litre plus VAT, with a 45 cent increase in one week alone. The operator says it is totally unsustainable and that the problem has come just when things were looking up after Covid.  In coach tourism, a contractor in Tipperary–Kilkenny signed contracts 18 to 24 months ago based on a rate of €1.29 per litre, allowing for an increase of 10 cent or 15 cent. Now, as we know, prices are in excess of €2 per litre, yet the Government is proposing to take just 15 cent off diesel. It went up 22 cent on the wholesale market yesterday. At best, the Government will bring diesel prices back to those of last Friday evening or Saturday morning. The businesses I have referred to are proud family businesses that provide employment in the four corners of Ireland. They are keeping Ireland moving but this is how they are treated. It is an absolute disgrace. To be clear about it, the Government is doing more on petrol than on diesel. The companies provide essential services. They run on diesel and do not have alternatives.

In the past year the price of diesel has risen by 33%, petrol is up 30%, tyres are up 50%, oil changes are up from €90 to €140 and other running costs are up. After two brutal years of Covid, taxi drivers are at the pin of their collar. They need support or they will go to the wall. They need more action on fuel costs. Will the Government do more on fuel costs? Hauliers were given €100. Other practical measures can be taken such as addressing the nine-year rule, which is a thing of the past. Cars have been laid up for two years. Will the Minister review that rule?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-06 09:50:00+01:00	Carbon Budget: Motion	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Murchú, Patricia Ryan and Martin Browne.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. The carbon budgets were proposed by the independent CCAC and, after detailed scrutiny and engagement with stakeholders, were recommended for adoption by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, though not unanimously. The advisory council’s evidence at the committee hearings was clear: we need immediate and urgent action, a whole-of-government approach and a complete reorientation and reprioritisation to ensure we can make the necessary changes now to help meet our targets in the years ahead. We heard from other experts who said the budgets do not go far enough, and that cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, what I took from the totality of the evidence and the deliberations, and I believe ours is a committee that is serious about its work, was that we do not have the luxury of more time. The time for talking on climate has passed; radical action is needed now. These carbon budgets are the advisory council’s best estimate and, if implemented, can deliver the 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  We in Sinn Féin are in no doubt about the scale of the climate crisis facing the world and, in line with our support for our 2030 and 2050 targets, we will vote to approve these carbon budgets as proposed by the advisory council, although the third budget should be subject to further discussion. While we agree with the ambition and the targets, we disagree fundamentally with many of the policy decisions the Government is implementing. We will continue to bring forward constructive alternatives that we believe will help us meet our targets in a fair and just way.  This debate on carbon budgets is timely, given the major report published on Monday by the UN's IPCC. The contents of the report are incontrovertible and the consequences of failing to act unimaginable. It can leave us in no doubt that it is now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. We are on track for an increase exceeding 3°C, with devastating consequences for the globe. We know what needs to be done and how to do it, and we now need the Government to lead and deliver the just transition that will reduce emissions and secure a liveable future, and not just talk about it.  The reduction in emissions set out in these budgets will be very challenging to achieve. This challenge has been made all the greater as a result of the failure to act in years gone by. It is precisely because successive Governments ignored repeated climate warnings from scientists and permitted our carbon emissions to accelerate over the past 20 years that we have been left scrambling to make radical changes now. Incoherent policies have also contributed to the challenges we now face in energy, transport, housing and elsewhere. While public transport is rightly encouraged, many areas across the State remain without real options. The investment was not made. Major public transport projects such as MetroLink or the Navan rail line have been repeatedly kicked down the road and remain undelivered, leaving these communities without sustainable transport modes. In my constituency this week, a lifeline public transport route, the 136, used by elderly people to get to and from the shops once a week is being pulled. That is public transport in Ireland in 2022.  At the same time, the red carpet was rolled out for energy-hungry data centres with no regard for our electricity generation capacity or the impact the policy would have on our national emissions. Similarly, successive governments gave us and championed a system of developer-led development. Communities got houses, houses, houses and urban sprawl. It was the opposite of compact growth or transport-led development. It created dependency on cars. There were no amenities, public parks or green spaces, and creaking infrastructure.  Ratoath in my constituency is one example. The water infrastructure in that town is crumbling under increased pressure from the growing population, leading to frequent water outages which impact on businesses, families, young and old and people with disabilities. As the town grew and developers and the local authority made money, citizens were and are being failed by the lack of timely investment in water infrastructure. There is a plan involving the Windmill Hill reservoir and trunk water main, but the work is too slow and outages far too frequent. I implore the Minister of State to contact the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to have that work expedited. It is an example of much talk but little action.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report highlights that in order to limit global warming, major change in the energy sector will be required. Thankfully, we have the tools and know-how, but now we need a focus on rapid delivery. Ireland is uniquely placed to become a world leader in offshore wind and reduce our emissions significantly, but we have heard from the wind industry that our 2030 renewable target is already in doubt. The Oireachtas climate committee in recent weeks heard that we have just a 50/50 chance of meeting our 2030 target of 5 GWs of offshore wind. This is at a time when the head of the EPA says we can expect emissions here to increase in 2022. They need to decrease by 4.8% to meet the carbon budgets.  We heard that we need greater numbers of personnel in the planning authorities like An Bord Pleanála and that we need to ensure our offshore planning processes are as speedy as possible. We heard we need investment in BirdWatch Ireland and other prescribed bodies to ensure planning is done in a sustainable way. We need updated and new regulations brought forward and investment in grid infrastructure. EirGrid is not fit for purpose. We need our ports to be developed to ensure we can build and maintain the turbines and develop the supply chain industry here. We should designate those ports today.  Green hydrogen goes hand in hand with offshore wind and offers the State huge potential for the export of this green energy to Europe. I brought forward a Bill seeking to develop a national green hydrogen strategy as soon as possible. We should strive to become a world leader in this field, and I hope the Minister of State acts on this soon.  In relation to onshore wind, we are still awaiting updated regulations, with the outdated ones having contributed to numerous development problems in the past. The delay in bringing this forward is unacceptable, and the industry says the same. If lessons are not learned from bad developments like Derrybrien, then we will not deliver the necessary onshore wind in the time ahead. There are weaknesses at every level of the system. It is not Sinn Féin propaganda to say that. The industry and the agencies say it, if not publicly, certainly privately.   Sinn Féin wants to see a more equitable retrofitting system, one that prioritises those living in fuel and energy poverty and targets grant support at those who need financial assistance. Middle-income earners who earn too much to avail of free energy upgrades but not enough to have money to invest in energy efficiency measures feel left behind.  We heard from the SEAI yesterday. It is behind on one-stop shop targets and on tackling the two-year backlog in the warmer home scheme. It has no plan for renters or for those just outside the eligibility criteria. The Minister of State can see a pattern here. Every scheme the Government builds, including retrofitting, EV grants and the bike to work scheme, fails the equity test. That is a problem. I am fed up listening to Government representatives congratulate themselves on climate. It is a reasonable estimate thatthis Government will miss every emission reduction target it set itself.   Government Members' defence is they are serious about climate because they have a carbon tax. This magic carbon tax is, on one hand, minuscule. The increase on 1 May will make no difference to people, we are told. On the other hand, it is the cornerstone of the Government's climate policy. It will pay for retrofitting, renewables and sustainable farming, all of which are behind schedule and have missed targets, and it will protect the most vulnerable. It will not and cannot do that. No single tax could do that. In the meantime, it will punish people for being poor and drive them against the climate agenda.   As always, there are alternatives. The money can and should be raised in a different way. For example, Sinn Féin proposed that the retrofitting budget be increased by €125m in 2022 and outlined tax increases in different areas that would fund this. A solidarity tax on those earning in excess of €140,000 and a tapering off of tax credits for those earning more than €100,000 are two examples. These two proposals would raise €408 million in a year and would not hit workers and families who are just about getting by as it is.  The science is clear, the targets are in place and we need a focus on rapid delivery from the Government if we are to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets. I echo the words of the IPCC chair: “We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future.” Carbon tax and tweaking the market will not do. Sinn Féin will play its part. We are serious about this but we want to see it delivered. It will be delivered only if it is done in a fair and equitable way. We have real concerns about the approach Government is taking. Go raibh maith agat.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-28 09:00:00+01:00	Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	3	We may not use it all.  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I thank Deputies Cronin and Kerrane for co-sponsoring it with me.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 aims to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to include explicit provision for the Minister to provide policy direction to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to introduce a moratorium on disconnections of gas and electricity supply to domestic customers for non-payment during the annual fuel allowance season or during other periods of time the Minister may deem appropriate. It is an important power that we seek to bestow on the Minister.  We know that the risk and reality of disconnection is something we need to address in a real way. We acknowledge there are powers there already under section 10A. We know the CRU has operated a voluntary code over the years at different times, including during Covid. However, if we track the disconnections in gas and electricity over the years, the most recent figures for 2019 show that there were more than 5,000 electricity disconnections and more than 2,400 gas disconnections, which were up on the previous year. Therefore, we know that more needs to be done to protect vulnerable customers, particularly during the difficult, cold winter months.   An additional power we seek to give the Minister is discretion to identify other periods the Minister may deem appropriate to initiate a ban on disconnections - for example, during the Covid period. We acknowledge that the voluntary scheme significantly reduced the number of disconnections during the Covid period. However, that is for a limited time. We are now living at a time of hyperinflation and a huge increases in cost of petrol and diesel and in the cost of living, putting families under huge pressure. Our proposal is that we would give people the protection, particularly during the winter months or at times otherwise deemed appropriate by the Minister, and to give people some breathing space by removing that threat of disconnection from over their head, however limited that space might be. We know from the figures that when there is not protection there, disconnections happen at a significant rate. This proposal gives people a bit of space to arrange their affairs, to enter into a payment plan, to get themselves back on track in terms of repaying the debt that is owed to the supplier or to engage with other agencies, as might be appropriate, whether the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other agencies to support them through the period. It provides a protection for vulnerable customers as well as a safety net and breathing space.  In my last minute, I will point to some of the commentary when section 10A, which is the provision that is there and we seek to amend, was introduced in 2006. The then Minister of State, John Browne, said that it was important that such power should be used sparingly and always in the public interest. That is exactly what we are talking about here. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, also contributed to the debate at that time. He said the regulated model had not worked because a regulator or bureaucrat based in the Department or the CRU could not take on the political responsibility to lead and that such a person could not take a decision on something awkward, difficult or risky, and that was the role of politicians. The power we want to bestow on the Minister is to protect during the winter months and to identify those periods in which the Minister would be given the discretion to implement a ban on disconnections to protect customers.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-28 09:00:00+01:00	Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	4	I thank my co-sponsors of the Bill for their contributions. We introduced the Bill on First Stage in March last year. We are in a different place now in some respects, in that the pandemic was raging at that time and war is now raging in Europe. However, from the perspective of vulnerable energy customers, we are very much in the same place and, if anything, in a far worse place.  I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's response. I will make a number of points in response to the arguments he made in defence of his position. He argues, through his amendment, that the power to impose moratoria on disconnection of electricity and gas already exists. We have acknowledged that, but there are two fundamental differences. The first is where the discretion lies and the second lies in the delivery of that power. Yes, the CRU can impose a moratorium when it sees fit to do so but we want a ban on disconnections every winter. What do we mean by winter? We mean the fuel allowance season, which does not run from 9 December to 11 January - a little more than four weeks - so that people can cook their Christmas dinner without fear of the power turning off. The fuel allowance season runs from the end of September until the start of April. Anyone who has lived through an Irish winter knows for certain that the worst weather can occur at either end of that period, particularly in the months of February and March. I know this too, having contested a by-election in 2013 in March when the ground was covered in snow every day. People know that. I challenge the Minister of State on the idea that the CRU has this power and uses it every winter. That is not the same as what we are saying. It is entirely different. The discretion of the Minister to identify periods outside winter, within which it may be appropriate to introduce a ban on disconnections, is an additional power that would be useful for him to have.  I refer to the point raised about who exercises the power. I have been in the role of spokesperson for a couple of years. In that time, I have had the opportunity to raise questions with a range of Departments, specifically on climate, communications and transport. I have never seen, in any other Department, such lack of direct ministerial accountability for matters that are the reserve of the Minister. In many cases, responsibility is deflected. Energy security is a fundamental responsibility of the Minister. If I ask questions in the House about energy security, they will be diverted to the CRU, and I will be told the CRU is accountable not to the Minister but to the Oireachtas joint committee. I am a member of that committee and I can guarantee that I speak for every member. I am not satisfied with the level of accountability of the CRU to the committee. From having sat on committees, as we all have, and it has also been reported on the national airwaves, the Minister knows about the accountability of civil servants and others to committees. That is not the case with the CRU. I mean no disrespect to the individual members of the CRU. They have their jobs to do but there are lines of responsibility. We are elected as public representatives or representatives of the people. We elect our Government, which elects our Ministers. That is the line of authority and the line of accountability back to the people. It is not to leave discretion with the CRU or another group. That is an abdication of responsibility by the Minister and is something that would be changed in the legislation, if it was adopted. I will go back to the words of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in 2006, when he spoke about departmental officials and members of the regulatory body. He stated: Such a person cannot take decisions or say something awkward, difficult or risky. In our democratic system, only politicians have the power to do that. It is a point the Minister has made, in fairness, in recent days and weeks regarding the responsibility of politicians. Accountability should lie with the Minister. That is a strength of our Bill, it is a weakness of the current position and it is a weakness in the Minister of State's argument, as far as I see it.  Those are the technical policy arguments regarding this matter, but the mean-spirited and offensive piece in the position of the Government and the Minister of State is that they are kicking the can down the road and will not act on this for 12 months. We will have another winter where the Government will be satisfied with a moratorium on disconnections for maybe four weeks. That is not good enough, by my account. We will oppose the Government's position and are likely to have a vote on it at some stage, but I ask the Minister of State to review his position on what we are saying to him. If he is saying that the provisions of our legislation are already catered for, we are firmly saying that is not the case. It is not the case in respect of where the responsibility lies and what winter means in Ireland.  The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board on this issue. He needs to get on to the Minister to provide those protections for people over these winter months. As we said, this is about providing breathing space for people over the winter months, among everything else, because they are already under pressure. I am sure the Minister of State is very familiar, as is the Minister, with the type of winter that is ahead of us. This winter, we know that fuel prices, electricity prices and gas prices have not yet fully reflected the impact or the full extent of the war in Ukraine. The Government is factoring in increases in the region of a further 50% to 70%. When we meet providers, they talk about a tsunami of indebtedness. That has the potential to be a tsunami of disconnections. This Government needs to provide protection for those customers over the winter months to provide that space for them. A handful of weeks over the Christmas period will not suffice.

They are essential workers and are expertly trained. They deliver a 24-7 service 365 days a year. Next Wednesday, in frustration at long-standing pay and career development issues that are affecting recruitment and retention in the sector, they are taking industrial action. They have engaged in negotiations but these have been unsuccessful. The Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, which represents medical scientists, is seeking meaningful talks. It should not have come to this. It sends a terrible signal to young people who might be considering entering STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics. What is the Government doing to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-18 09:10:00+01:00	Just Transition: Statements	1	I welcome these statements. They take place on the day of the publication of another major report outlining the damage global warming is doing to our planet and all its inhabitants. The State of the Global Climate report from the World Meteorological Organization, WMO, shows that the four key climate change indicators - greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification - broke records in 2021. The WMO said this is another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes with long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems. The findings and statistics in this report and the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, findings will come as no shock to most, as the science has been clear for decades. What has been missing, however, is action. We know what needs to be done and we know how to do it. What we need now is the Government to lead and deliver.  There will be no transition without a just transition. That is a matter of fact. A just transition is a critical component of climate action. A just transition means the bringing together of workers, communities, employers and the Government in social dialogue in order to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fast and fair transformation to a low-carbon economy and to ensure that employment and jobs in the new economy are as decent and well-paid as those left behind. I wish to raise concerns, first, with the timelines, but also with the narrow scope of what the Government means by a just transition, which seems to be limited to the midlands. It certainly needs to apply there, but it also needs to apply in the broadest sense to everybody who is involved in this transition.  We discussed the importance of a just transition and climate justice at length during the extensive debates on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. During those debates, Sinn Féin and others brought forward amendments that would have defined what constitutes a just transition in the Act and ensured that the climate action plans were drafted with reference to just transition principles. The Government rejected all amendments tabled on Committee Stage and Report Stage however, and, as a result, the Act and the climate policies flowing from it are weaker because they fail to meet the bar of equity and fairness. They fail to deliver a just transition.  Retrofitting is one such policy area that is failing the just transition equity test. Sinn Féin agrees that we need to retrofit the housing stock to reduce emissions and energy use, but where we disagree is how the Government is approaching it. The Minister has introduced a new scheme this year, which prioritises ability to pay over need. If someone is fortunate enough to have €25,000 available, he or she can now get a grant of €25,000 to retrofit their home, regardless of whether the financial help is needed. I am sure the Minister of State will tell us this is balanced out by the free energy upgrades for others, but what he fails to mention is the 8,000 homes already on the growing waiting list and a delay of 27 months to get works done. The target of completing 400 homes a month is still not being achieved, despite what has been claimed by some. Under the new plan, those who have money are generously supported to get a warmer home sooner. They are at the top of the list. For every euro in carbon tax they pay, they are getting a very good return. People who qualify for the free energy upgrade must sit tight for two years or more. Someone might get to them eventually. All the while they will pay more in carbon tax to heat their homes. They will get some return on the carbon tax, but it will be slow and in the vast majority of cases the retrofits are not deep retrofits. However, renters or those on a low income who earn too much to qualify for the free scheme but not enough to afford works themselves, like very many people, are out of luck. Such people will get no return on their carbon tax.  The national retrofit scheme is devoid of equity. It is benefiting those with means over those in need, and was not designed with a just transition in mind. There is a better, fairer way. We could start with the national social housing stock. We could identify those living in fuel poverty or reliant on solid fuels and start with them. We could put an income cap in place to ensure more money can be targeted at those who need it most. There are options in this area, but the Government is choosing not to take them. It is a long way off a just transition, but at the very least we should make sure that this transition does not drive people into poverty or further into poverty. The Government is failing to do that. It is just transition, it is not just stop being poor transition.  It is not just the retrofitting policy that fails the test, it is the same when it comes to electric vehicle grants. People with the money to buy a brand-new €50,000 car can get a €5,000 grant and €5,000 off the vehicle registration tax, VRT. They will also get a home charger grant, cheaper motor tax and reduced tolls. That is a very good return on their carbon tax. If, like most, however, you are unable to afford a new car, there is nothing for you except higher prices at the forecourts due to the ever-increasing costs. Similarly, PAYE workers can get a significant discount on a bicycle or an e-bike, but there is nothing for students, the self-employed or unemployed. To state it clearly again, Sinn Féin agrees with retrofitting. We agree with the need for electric vehicles. We agree with the need to get more people cycling and involved in active travel, but we want to see fairer policies that will deliver these measures while prioritising those most in need. We need an approach encompassing a just transition. The Government's alternative is driving a wedge between people. It is leaving people behind and in the only measure that matter, emissions reductions, it is failing miserably.  The Minister will have received correspondence in advance of this debate from the Just Transition Alliance. This alliance includes the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, TASC, SIPTU, Fórsa, Friends of the Earth and others. They have called for the establishment of a national just transition commission, in advance of formal legislation at the end of the year, based on social dialogue and comprised of representatives of the Government, trade unions, employers, affected communities and civil society. The commission would focus on job retention; the protection of living standards; skills development; the creation of decent work in respect of new employment opportunities; the prioritisation of the most vulnerable regions and sectors; and would be underpinned by a commitment to genuine community and regional development. Sinn Féin supports this call. I hope the Minister of State can update us on this area.  The transition to a zero-carbon society and economy does not have to be punitive or achieved through eco-austerity. The framing is completely wrong. This transition should transform and improve the lives of millions in this country by means of warmer homes, cleaner air, shorter commutes, cheaper electricity and greener spaces. Unfortunately, this Government's approach means that most people just see cost. They see hypocrisy when it comes to data centres, and they see unfairness when it comes to policies. We need to invest in public transport; build good quality public housing; invest in wind and solar renewable energy; undertake a truly ambitious afforestation programme; and retrofit our national housing stock, starting with those in need, not those with ability to pay. A just transition should be at the heart of all Government policies, and it is conspicuous by its absence at the moment.

We had some of the team in the audiovisual room last Tuesday, before the first day of strike action. Most of all, I commend medical scientists from right around the country on the resolve they have shown. Others have talked about the fundamental issues at play here, including pay parity, the 20-year claim and the expert review. The present Taoiseach was the Minister responsible at the time. Others have pointed to the addition of insult to injury among laboratory aides. I do not think there is a medical scientist in the country who would deny laboratory aides the wage they get. It is a recognition of the valuable contribution they make. It is, however, a further indication of the contradiction within the system that the people to whom they are answerable get paid less than them.  I welcome the fact there is an engagement at the Labour Court but, as my colleagues have said, it must be a meaningful one and must come with an understanding of the issues and a willingness and an ability to find solutions. I implore the Minister to engage with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to find those solutions and to be creative. There is huge opportunity to be creative here and it needs to extend beyond 1%.  I will touch on two major issues. I worked as a medical scientist and, looking now from the outside in, I wish to reflect on my experience of that profession and to touch on two issues: dedication and excellence.  Many Members have talked about dedication. This is a 24-7, 365-day service, including Christmas Day, New Year's Day and bank holidays, whether 3 o'clock in the morning or 3 o'clock in the evening, and harsh winters, including those of 2013 and 2017. Some colleagues mentioned staff working 15 days straight during Covid. At times, including during Storm Ophelia, medical scientists have not left the building for up to a week without thinking twice about it, such is their level of dedication. It is mainly women who do this work, including during Covid. Where was the support for childcare at that time? It was not there. That was another example. When I started work as a medical scientist, some of my colleagues had lived with the marriage bar. I think it is no coincidence we are in this position with a profession dominated by women.  I wish to touch on the issue of excellence. We do not see it in very many places. In medical science there is a culture of excellence driven by the staff's dedication and commitment, which has not been for reward, because the Government has introduced a glass ceiling for them. As colleagues have said, they are an essential part of practically every clinical decision. They have degrees, including masters degrees. Some have multiple masters degrees, PhDs, FRCPaths and MRCPaths. The internal journal is called   This is pioneering science, not off-the-shelf stuff. In many cases staff build these assays from the ground up. We have seen during Covid-19, in practically every lab, staff do their own basic science, pure science, building the assays, including the most high-tech of molecular science, from the ground up. These are fully accredited laboratories. It was the Joint Commission when I started; now it is INAB 15189. There is an obligation on transfusion labs. The other labs do it because they want to maintain the highest standards. The recruitment and retention crisis the Government has created is putting those standards under pressure. There is a spectacular opportunity here. These are the best of public services. We should be putting them up in lights and rewarding them, and that is what the Minister needs to do.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-31 14:00:00+01:00	Transport, Accelerating Sustainable Mobility: Statements	5	This is the Minister's first time in the Dáil Chamber since the incidents of the weekend. He is the Minister for Transport. The people of Ireland are looking to the Minister and his Department for leadership on this matter. The Minister can take it or leave it, but my opinion is that to neglect that, not reference it and not provide confidence and comfort to people who either went through the experience of Dublin Airport at the weekend or who will be travelling next weekend or further into the future, is incredible.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter of transport. While there are many areas I could focus on, the events of the weekend put one matter ahead of all others. As an island nation, air connectivity is vital for family, social, tourism and business purposes. The aviation sector has endured two difficult years during the pandemic with many workers losing their jobs and thousands of others suffering severe pay cuts. A rapid return to normality was hoped for and thankfully that is now materialising. Unfortunately, our main State airport failed to read the signs of recovery over the past year and was completely ill-prepared for the long-awaited rebound.  During the pandemic, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, slashed employee numbers. It cut 1,000 staff. That was completely excessive, short-sighted and highlighted a total disregard for workers. It was also incredibly ill-judged for an authority with responsibility in the aviation sector. The DAA is now scrambling to refill these jobs, which should not have been abolished in the first place. In short, abolishing them was a penny-wise-and-pound-foolish approach. If the DAA had talked to a sinner soul on this island during the pandemic, it would have known that people were chomping at the bit to get back to travel. In addition, Ireland is home to Ryanair, one of the most successful and aggressive airlines on the planet. As a result, the airport should have been better prepared for a more rapid aviation recovery compared with other airports. If aviation was going to recover anywhere, it was going to recover in Ireland. Instead, the DAA was caught on the hop and passengers have paid the price.  Dublin Airport management is simply not performing, and that is not just when it comes to unacceptable security wait times. Complaints have been made about the uncleanliness of the airport, long queues for food and beverage outlets in the terminals, more delays for baggage pick-up and the struggle to get taxis. We even saw an ugly brawl in the terminal recently. The Garda response to the incident was slow, despite the opening of a brand-new Garda station in the airport this month. It all adds up to an unpleasant experience for passengers, with many dreading the thought of using the airport to go to and from Ireland.  It is having an incredibly negative impact on our international reputation. We spend millions each year marketing Ireland as a great tourist destination but coverage of this travel chaos on the BBC, in   I raised the issue of security delays with the Minister at the start of April when the problem arose ahead of the Easter break. I asked him what action he was taking to address this problem. The Minister said he was monitoring the situation and was arranging meetings with the management of the airport. The same response came yesterday when yet another meeting took place with management. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, have stated that they will now hold daily meetings with management about this problem. Meetings are all we have had. That is it. What have these meetings achieved to date and what is discussed at them? By the look of things, it is not solutions.  The Government has a really important role to play in this matter. We are talking about the busiest State airport in the country, with 85% of all air traffic going through it. There are solutions the Government can push to help to fix this issue. First, excellent pay and working conditions are central to resolving it. There have been reports about low pay, long shifts and issues with workers getting paid their overtime. Good pay and conditions will help to attract and retain security staff in our airports. In the short term, extra personnel clearly need to be drafted into Dublin Airport, whether from other airports or, for example, by utilising Army personnel. Everything needs to be on the table. We also need to see a fast-tracking of recruitment and training for new staff.  In the medium term, as well as investment in workers, we need to see investment in new security screening equipment. Last year, Shannon Airport invested in upgrading its security machines, which removes the need to take liquids and laptops out of bags. This has the potential to speed things up significantly. In the longer term, we need a plan to rebalance some of the Dublin Airport traffic to other airports, including Cork, Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock. As I said, 85% of traffic currently goes through Dublin.  The Minister for Transport cannot wash his hands of this problem. All Ministers needs to step up and take responsibility. They cannot just turn up at the airport when a ribbon needs cutting. When the pressure is on, they need to stand up and be counted.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-01 09:10:00+01:00	Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Report and Final Stages	1	I thank Deputies Whitmore and Cairns for bringing forward these amendments, which I support. They are consistent with attempts made by the Opposition at various stages, including in the debate on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and on earlier Stages of this Bill, to enshrine the principles of just transition in legislation in Ireland. We look towards other jurisdictions - Scotland, for example - where this has been done. It makes a difference because it enshrines a commitment in this regard in law. It means that all of the policy that stems from the important legislation in this area must be in line with those principles.  In recent weeks, we had statements in the House on a just transition. One can see there is a really narrow focus from the Government on particular geographical areas and particular cohorts. In fact, a commitment to just transition needs to permeate absolutely everything we do in terms of climate change. Today's report from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, refers specifically to the need for implementation and action. Much of the resistance to climate action is because of the unjust and unfair way in which it is being imposed and delivered. People are not being given the opportunity to see the benefits of, and everything that is positive about, essential climate action.  It speaks volumes that there is such resistance to amendments like these linked ones that have been put forward by Deputy Cairns. I hope the Minister will support them. However, if past performance is any indication, there will be opposition to them. I question where that opposition comes from. If we are serious about delivering on the targets that have been set and agreed on so widely, then the definition of the principles of just transition, in the broadest possible sense, is fundamental to the real-world delivery of those targets. We must ensure people on the front line, in such sectors as the fossil fuel industry, are protected. However, it is necessary for everybody to make a transition. For every decision we make, we need to think in terms of just transition, equity and ensuring the policy decisions that are made do not drive people into poverty, including fuel poverty, or further into poverty. It is fair enough if measures taken reduce some people's wealth but they should not drive people into poverty or further into poverty. Unfortunately, that is what is happening with some of the measures we have seen from the Government. I support these amendments.

They have taken on board some of what the Opposition and some Government Members said during that debate. That said, there is an opportunity to go further and I share concerns that it does not adequately capture the potential of the circular economy. At the moment, perversely, the limited plastics recycling facilities that we have on the island cannot source plastics from this State because it is more profitable to export them elsewhere. We must consider also the carbon footprint associated with that. It is ludicrous that it is circular but far from the spirit of what circular could mean and should mean. This needs to be addressed. I do not believe this captures it sufficiently.

This is a long-standing issue with regard to supports for people with medical-associated additional waste needs. It is very unfair and is one of those things that frustrates people. It affects a small number of people, is cruel and needs to be resolved. Looking at parliamentary questions, this issue comes up across the political spectrum. Everybody seems to agree on it but nothing changes. Now is an opportune time to do something about it and I support Deputy Sherlock's call in that regard.

I welcome the fact the Minister has brought forward amendment No. 19 on foot of discussions on Committee Stage. We raised previously the prospect of taking an initiative such as that which was taken in France. The Department indicated there were considerations in the Irish market that differed from those in the French market, such as longer supply chains, but I welcome the commitment to preparing a report and assessing the prospect and how such a change might be implemented in an Irish context.

There will be further discussion in the Seanad and colleagues of mine will bring forward amendments, as I am sure others will as well.  I am disappointed there were not amendments on CCTV and the need for caution with it. Significantly more needs to be done in the area of product obsolescence. I would, given the opportunity, have supported the amendment from the Labour Party. We need to see action on that. On Committee Stage, the Government pointed to the need to act at a European level. We need to see more on that. We need to see the deposit return scheme. I share the concerns of other Deputies about the possible unintended consequences of the latte levy and the implications there. I think we will bring forward amendments on that in the Seanad. There is a crazy anomaly with the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, plastics in Ireland. Due to the configuration of levies and incentives here, it makes more sense to export it to I do not where - certainly the four corners of Europe, if not of the world - than it does to run it up the road to County Monaghan so it can be done here. The Minister has been contacted by Shabra Plastics and Recycling Limited and I know there are ongoing discussions. It makes no sense at all. State agencies such as Repak and others are a part of that mix and it has to be resolved.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Broin, Mac Lochlainn, Kerrane and Doherty. This motion sets out a number of proposals that we believe are essential to address the cost-of-living crisis. They are specifically focused on the price of electricity. I call for support for the motion across the House. We need an aggressive and comprehensive response to an unprecedented crisis which is having a significant impact on families and is the most pressing concern for families around the country. We set out in the motion our proposals to cut household electricity bills and cap them at 2021 prices, to introduce cash payments to assist low and middle-income households with their other energy bills, to make a double child benefit payment for every child in recognition of the fact that larger households have greater energy and electricity demands, and, importantly, to introduce a windfall tax in order that excess profits are used for the benefit of our population and people in need. The motion has a number of proposals which will be part of a suite of social welfare and taxation measures that Sinn Féin will propose in our alternative budget in advance of the Government's budget.  In my contribution, I will focus on a couple of aspects, namely, the electricity price cap and the windfall tax. They are intimately related proposals. A clear recognition that the market is broken and must be reformed underpins both proposals. This has been clear for over a year. Gas is being used as a weapon of war. Any of us who have engaged with those working in this sector have had it indicated to us that it was apparent, as far back as this time last year, or earlier, that the tap was being turned by Russia.  The electricity price cap is the right move at the right time. It provides certainty for families who are under huge pressure. It provides a reprieve for families at a time of great pressure and uncertainty. While it is not a permanent solution, it buys time to introduce the sort of systematic reforms that are needed. We have to get the balance of universal measures and targeted measures right. We need to lean towards prioritising targeted measures. As a universal measure, it has the advantage of maintaining the link with usage. It is, in effect, an electricity unit price cap as opposed to an electricity bill price cap. We saw the Government's proposal for a credit being introduced slowly earlier this year. We have seen the various kites flown in recent weeks: it could be a €600 credit over three payments or it could be further beyond that; it would be denied to Travellers in halting sites, as it was before; it would be denied to some living in multi-unit buildings where there is only one meter; and it would be given on the double to people with holiday homes - energy credits will be a bonanza for those people. That proposal from the Government has the same weaknesses that it always had. It goes hand in hand with a windfall tax, individual and important elements to address a broken market, and the super-excess and crisis-related profits of energy companies. There are two parts to any windfall tax, which are the huge profits being made by energy generators, which the European Union refers to as a solidarity tax, and the huge windfall that arises for renewable companies because of the pegging of gas prices to electricity prices. The suggestion that Sinn Féin is at risk of writing a blank cheque to energy companies is the greatest bluff of them all, especially coming from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who are the parties that sold off our gas assets. Vermilion Energy reported a 267% increase in Corrib profits between 2020 and 2021. In the second quarter of this year, the parent company recorded €214 million in profits, up 28% year on year. That was all sold off to the private interests. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael also sold off our gas utility companies, deregulated the market and, as they did with so many things, treated energy as a commodity not as a right and a utility. This Government fought for a year against reforms of the EU energy market. Why? It was to protect the profits of the energy companies in the hope, nothing more, that they would invest those profits in new energy infrastructure, some of which was hoped would be renewables. We missed the opportunity of the Iberian exemption, despite having a real opportunity to make the exact same case. This Government has a clear track record of not doing enough. The Sinn Féin proposals contained in tonight's motion point in the right direction.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-12 09:12:00+01:00	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	1	I will support the amendment. We have articulated previously that the Government’s approach is not the one we would have taken. There are always strengths and weaknesses with universal measures, and a number of the weaknesses of this approach would not arise with the introduction of a cap on prices. There are particular weaknesses to this approach and many of them relate to the fact that it is not targeted, that there are anomalies within it and that some cohorts are excluded and disadvantaged by it while others are advantaged. Perversely, those who are in the greatest need, as is often the case, are the ones who are disadvantaged.  We again heard on Second Stage that the issue of Travellers on halting sites who share one meter point reference number, MPRN, has not been resolved. During that debate, the Minister of State indicated this applies to about 1,000 people. That should be resolved and there is no excuse for it not yet having been. We have raised this issue repeatedly in committee, including in front of some of his colleagues such as the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, when the underspend on the previous scheme was being diverted to buy diesel generators and it was acknowledged this was an issue. It was acknowledged as an issue months ago, yet still there has been no resolution. Their party colleagues will acknowledge it as an issue when they appear in the media but nothing moves. We need clarity on how this scheme and the previous one will be directed towards Travellers on halting sites.  The same goes for renters and people who live in communal heating or local district heating accommodation, as well as those living in multi-unit accommodation with just one meter. Having seen representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and others appear before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on repeated occasions, I believe there is an underwhelming level of energy, enthusiasm and engagement regarding these challenges. It is clear what needs to be done. As in the case of our energy poverty strategy, we need to identify those people who need the support and provide mechanisms to give that targeted support. If we did that, we would be in a position to address some of the anomalies in this universal measure.  The flip side of this, of course, is that people who have holiday homes, perhaps Deputies, Senators and other high-income earners, do very well out of this and, as has been said, get a benefit, sometimes on the double, treble or quadruple, depending on how many properties they have, that they do not need in relative terms. It is that disproportionality in the relative impact of this cost-of-living and energy crisis that is not reflected in this measure. The mechanism in this amendment would go some way towards addressing that when we next come to this position.  Another group, of course, who need to be protected in this space are people who use pay-as-you-go meters. Again, as in the case of the CRU and the Minister of State's colleagues when they appear in the media, there is an acknowledgement that there is a particular set of challenges, but when it comes to finding a solution, there is none to be found. We heard this again today from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is simply not good enough. We tabled a number of amendments that sought to achieve a greater targeting and protection for people who are more exposed but they were ruled out of order. We had specific amendments relating to pay-as-you-go meters. While this legislation may not be the place to resolve that, it absolutely needs to be resolved somewhere. We never hear the reason amendments have been ruled out of order, but the Government needs to provide, in clear terms, a solution for people who use these meters. We have spelled that solution out, as we did in an amendment that was ruled out of order. The Government can implement it, if not in this legislation then in the real world. It can extend the friendly credit and ensure there will be the same protections for pay-as-you-go meter users as there are for bill-pay meter users. If a bill-pay meter user does not have the funds to pay his or her bill, the lights and the gas will stay on, whereas for a pay-as-you-go meter user, that is not the case. That needs to be resolved and there are a number of ways that could happen, such as by extending the friendly credit or the emergency credit or by ensuring that anybody who wants to be transferred to a bill-pay meter can do so free of charge, not just the vulnerable cohorts. The Government needs to act on that because there are deeply unfair implications and consequences arising from the formula it has used to deliver this universal support.

This is another one of those anomalies where things that are left open sometimes result in those who are intended and entitled to receive a credit not receiving it. I want to add to the examples that have been given and detail the additional complexity that arises where there is a multi-unit facility with one MPRN and individual pay-as-you-go meters. There are a number of these around this city and there is the additional and combined problem of individual landlords possibly not passing on the credit, as well as the lack of protection against disconnections. The people affected are particularly exposed and are getting less support than many others. This amendment would go some way towards addressing that disadvantage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 14:00:00+01:00	Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I move: That Dáil Éireann: notes: — that the latest round of energy price hikes announced by energy providers is putting severe financial pressure on people; — that households are facing extraordinary costs to light and heat their homes this winter, and will need equivalent support from the Government and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) during this time; — that, in the first half of 2022, there were 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections due to non-payment of account; — that there are 260,000 residential electricity pre-pay customers and 118,000 residential pre-pay gas customers; — the lack of research and monitoring into so called ""self-disconnections"", and into the number of people who are disconnected from pre-pay meters; — that Sinn Féin's Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 sought to extend the moratorium on disconnections to run over the entire Fuel Allowance season, to give financially struggling households assurance that they will not be left in the cold and dark during the winter months; — that the Government delayed the second reading of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 by 12 months; and — the CRU confirmation, at the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action, that they lack the legislative remit to regulate standing charges on utility bills; acknowledges  — that households need financial and regulatory support during this energy price crisis, not the threat of disconnections hanging over them; condemns  — the Government's failure to put in place a protection from disconnections for those who use pre-pay meters; and calls for: — a moratorium on disconnections to be immediately put in place for all households until the end of the Fuel Allowance season; — the friendly credit on pre-pay meters to be extended for the duration of the ban on disconnections to give pre-pay meter households the same protection from disconnections as other households; — legislation to be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills; — the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates; and — a windfall solidarity tax to be introduced on the excess profits of energy companies. This motion seeks to do a number of important things. It seeks to extend the moratorium on electricity and gas disconnections to all customers from now until the end of the fuel allowance season, which is late March or early April. A ban on disconnections is currently in place but it is far too limited. It applies to self-identified and registered medically vulnerable bill-pay customers. In other words, it applies to a subset, self-identified, of a subset, registered, of a subset, medically vulnerable, of a subset, bill-pay. It was introduced on 1 October and runs until the end of the March. It is far too limited in its scope. For other bill-pay customers the ban on disconnection kicks in from 1 December and runs to the end of February. That is an extremely limited three-month ban at a time when 581,000 people are living below the poverty line according to European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, Ireland. This is also a time when up to 43% of people - which is a record, but a conservative estimate - are at risk of or living in energy poverty, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. It is also a time when the Government’s budget is failing to keep pace with the cost of living, according to the Vincentian research centre. It is also a time when energy suppliers are disconnecting approximately 170 domestic gas and electricity customers every month.  In the case of pay-as-you-go customers, there is no ban on disconnections despite the Taoiseach’s public comments, which gave rise to headlines such as ""Taoiseach confirms pay-as-you-go utility customers will not be disconnected if unable to top up"", ""Taoiseach: no disconnections of pay-as-you-go energy users this winter"" and ""Pay-as-you-go energy customers will not be disconnected this winter – Taoiseach"". In the days and weeks that followed those statements, it became quite clear that the Taoiseach had no intention of delivering on that commitment. Instead, people were told that there would be a €10 extra emergency credit. It has now increased to €20. Is that enough? People were told to contact the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In other words, they were told to make contact with charities. That is not the answer. People were told to go to the community welfare officer. This shows just how out of touch this Government and its Ministers are. In the first nine months of this year, the number of exceptional needs claims increased by 66,000, or 37%. Claims are processed in weeks or months, not hours or even days. That is most certainly not the answer.  We were told that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was meeting with all the energy suppliers and with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. There was some indication that we would have movement. Instead the Minister came away from those meetings and with a straight face went on national radio to tell us that pay-as-you-go is actually good for people.  Nothing was said about the rip-off tariffs that they are on, the rip-off standing charges being applied or the number of medically vulnerable people who are on pay-as-you-go meters and should be on bill pay and most certainly nothing was said about the need to extend the exact same protections and supports to pay-as-you-go customers as we have for bill-pay customers. As we set out in our motion, it can and should be done through the extension of the so-called friendly credit and it should happen immediately. The risk of disconnection from gas and electricity should be lifted from families. It is a matter of the values that we, as a country, hold in this Republic.  Our motion also calls for legislation to be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills. We further call on the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates and to introduce a windfall and solidarity tax on the excess profits of energy companies.  This is a time of extreme crises – an energy crisis and a cost-of-living crisis. The State needs to stretch itself. This Government took the recommendations at face value from the CRU and did nothing with them. They should have been stress tested and challenged. That organisation does not hold up well in the current climate. They should have been challenged and extended. Sinn Féin has a suite of proposals that the Minister needs to take and implement."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 14:00:00+01:00	Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]	2	The Minister of State and the Minister filled their time and talked about everything but the issue at hand. This was particularly so with the clear call for the extension of the disconnection ban to all customers from now until the end of March. There was no commitment from Government to do that. There was no commitment to provide a solution for pay-as-you-go customers. The solution there would be to ensure they have the exact same protections as billpay customers have. The Government did not provide a solution for them. I think I am right in saying, and it would be important to clarify this, that the facility to transfer onto a billpay contract is limited only to vulnerable customers. As I said before, that is a subset of a subset of a subset of a subset. That provision should be made available to all customers.  Not opposing this motion while not supporting it either amounts to a shameful abandonment of those people, who are in deep need of support from this Government. It is not a big ask to extend the fundamental principle that in the middle of a crisis, we in this Republic will not disconnect people from heat and light this winter. It should not be a challenge. However, this is a reflection of a failure of Government to support people in need.  The argument was made that pay-as-you-go is good for some people as it helps them manage their bills. It is offensive. It completely misses the point. We know people are, for want of a better term, self-disconnecting. We know people are facing real financial hardship but they are not being supported. This Government is pretending they do not exist. That is in effect what it is doing and it is the sum total of the Minister and Minister of State's contributions to this debate. At the root of all this is an argument of moral hazard, namely, that there is a cohort of people we cannot extend the same protection to because they could not manage their affairs. That is insulting, offensive and is implied by the fact the Government will not extend the same protections to that cohort of people as it has to everybody else. I wanted to put that on record. People can see through it.  There is an opportunity to address it, which we have spelled out. The Government should extend the friendly credit. It should show those people it will support them over this winter. The Government does not even count the people who are so-called self-disconnecting. They are being completely disregarded and explained away on the basis it is good for them to manage their own accounts. They need to be supported. They deserve the exact same protections as the rest of us.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-26 09:10:00+01:00	Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	"It is ironic. Such is the curtailed nature of this whole debate, the Minister of State cannot deliver the most basic of remarks reflecting the contents of the Bill within the guillotined time he has. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows how we feel on this side of the House on so many occasions when it comes to legislation and emergency legislation from the Minister.  This is yet more emergency legislation that is being rushed through by the Government due to the unmitigated failure to manage our electricity demand and supply. It is quite remarkable that we are now being asked to completely set aside important planning and environmental conditions for the installation of 450 MW of power generators. In effect, it is more than a topical issue; I would say that it is a national scandal.  At the outset, I must state my discomfort about bypassing the planning and environmental impact assessment process, as that brings with it obvious risks. In truth, it is an invidious position for the Opposition. This Government has walked the State to the cliff edge when it comes to energy security, electricity supply, and the risk of blackouts. As a result, we urgently need backup generators put in place to try to help keep the lights on in the coming winters. This is acknowledged and we will be responsible in our opposition.  As I have said before with regard to previous legislation and it also applies to this proposed legislation, this is no way to do scrutiny and is no way to do legislation. The Bill received no pre-legislative scrutiny and is being rushed through all Stages in one day. It is curtailed in a way that is far more extreme than we are used to, such is the nature of it. It is a dreadful approach. It is the wrong approach. I would imagine that it is, at least in part, related to the absolute chaos and frantic goings on within the Department and within the Ministry.  The Bill seeks to set aside normal planning and environmental requirements to allow emergency electricity generators to be installed quickly at two existing power plants, Shannonbridge and Tarbert, or at some as yet unidentified place, for operation in the coming winters. Despite the fact that Ukraine is referenced in the Title, we do not need these generators because we have just run out of gas due to that dreadful war. We do not need them because the shipments of oil have stopped. We need these extra generators because of the spectacular mismanagement of our electricity supply and demand over the past number of years. Successive Governments, the CRU, and EirGrid all share some responsibility for this failure. We simply do not have enough generation capacity to meet the growing electricity demand. This is despite repeated warnings over a number of years about the growing shortfall. Again, this is unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine. The Government should take responsibility for its failures in this area and not try and hide behind other external factors.  Last June, when we were dealing with another emergency item of legislation, the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told us he had appointed the former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy, to undertake a review of how we ended up in this crisis. That is appropriate. Will the Minister provide an update on the status of this review? When will the review be completed and will he publish it in full? Will there be accountability up to and including ministerial level and the agencies?  We do not need to wait for the McCarthy review to tell us some of the contributory factors. EirGrid has said that since 2016, its generation capacity statements have warned of an increasing tightness between demand and supply. In addition, EirGrid issued 18 amber alerts since 2017, with 17 of these since this Government took office in 2020. These were all flashing red lights that went unheeded.  All the while, it was full steam ahead for the rampant increase on the demand side and especially in the expansion of data centres. The policy was to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world. We all recognise the role data centres play in a digitised society but it was reckless in the extreme to pursue this approach so vigorously when our offshore wind generation was non-existent, when power plants were ageing and being wound down and when there were clear warnings about the increasing tightness between demand and supply. In truth, the State and the Government could have brought forward this legislation 12 months ago, but it did not. It was conscious Government choices that contributed to the current situation.  Another contributory factor to this current situation was the Government’s failure to develop our offshore wind over the past decade. Along with others, I was in Scotland recently, visiting the Moray East offshore wind farm and I witnessed at first hand how far ahead of us they are, specifically due to choices they made in recent years. The Fine Gael Administrations that we have had here over the past decade wasted a huge opportunity to exploit our massive offshore wind potential over this time. It was a lack of vision, whether it was for offshore, onshore or solar. It was a lack of vision and a lack of foresight. To put it simply, they failed the people of Ireland. As a result, we are still hugely reliant on imported energy and are now required, in a climate emergency, to continue to build more fossil fuel infrastructure to help meet our basic electricity demands. If we had developed just a fraction of our offshore wind potential by now or if we had expanded our onshore or solar generation, we would not need to procure this new capacity at this scale and in this way with expensive diesel generators. Instead, we could have relied on existing infrastructure or less demand.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, outline for how long these generators will be in place? We are aware that these generators will be in place until 2027 but perhaps a Minister of State will outline the process for decommissioning them or for moving them on. This issue was raised at a previous stage but during their operation, who exactly will own the generators when they are operating and afterwards? How will that structure work? This question had been raised, in fairness, from the Government and from the Opposition at various Stages of the passage of the recent EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill. This issue still needs to be addressed. Will the Minister of State outline how these facilities and generators will be procured, what will be the ownership structure for them, how will they be sold on and what will be the terms of that? There is a real concern that we will roll forward a number of years to 2027 and having spent €350 million, which is a huge amount of taxpayers' money, they would be sold off for a song or that some private entity will reap the huge rewards of that. What protections are there for the taxpayers' €350 million?  During the debate on the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill, a question arose about the charge that would be added to ordinary household electricity bills to help to cover the €350 million cost. The Minister did not have a specific figure at that time. Will the Minister of State confirm how much this procurement process will add to ordinary people's bills to cover the cost of the 450 MW? A figure of €40 was speculated on but is that figure confirmed? It is clear now that it is not €200 million and that it will be €350 million.  In the last minute I have to speak I will touch on some of the amendments that Sinn Féin has submitted. We will have even less time to discuss those later on. The first is a concern that is shared by many others and it came up at the very short briefing we had with the Department on this. It concerns the text ""or at alternative appropriate sites"". I believe that this is far too vague. I question whether it is consistent with the provisions of the directive. It certainly leaves it very loose.  We also have an important amendment, and I hope the Minister of State will support it, to require a report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas following a post-enactment review. This is unprecedented legislation. It gives huge powers and sidesteps significant protections for communities. It should not be done lightly. There should be a review and it should be laid before the Houses."

I want to make a point about some of the other amendments in the grouping. I support all of them, especially amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Bacik. It does what a number of other amendments seek to do, namely to increase transparency, accountability, scrutiny and the assessment of the particular projects that are to be delivered. I have tabled an amendment relating to a review and I notice that another amendment relates to assessing and identifying the climate impact of these projects. These are entirely sensible, reasonable and practical proposals from the Opposition and I really believe the Minister should take them on board and act on them. I am sure that in 30 minutes we will not get to all of them but I think the Minister should support them.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2022-10-27 09:00:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	The next time the Dáil sits, COP27 will be under way. The conference will hear that greenhouse gas emissions were at record levels last year. Ireland has ambitious targets that are agreed. They include a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. To achieve that, offshore wind will play a significant role. Our ports will also play a significant role but they will need to be ready. We know they sought funding through the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, but they were not successful. We do not have a port that is ready for the manufacture and installation of offshore wind infrastructure. They will need significant funding, be it through the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or green funds. Is this a priority for the Tánaiste and his Department? Will there be a commitment to funding next year and in the years ahead to realise the opportunity of offshore wind and to drive down our emissions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-27 09:00:00+01:00	Energy Security: Statements	1	The war in Ukraine has exposed how vulnerable this State is to volatility in the international energy markets and reinforced the need to radically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and become energy-independent. Ireland imports a little over 70% of the energy we use and this is well over the EU average of 58%. Oil accounts for 45% of primary energy needs and gas for a further 34%. All of the oil used in Ireland is imported, as is three quarters of our gas. This highlights our massive reliance on others to keep the lights on and the economy moving. Despite having an almost unlimited amount of renewable energy available off our coast and on our rooftops, the failure to develop this over the past 20 years has significantly contributed to our energy insecurity.  Offshore wind can deliver energy independence and security for our island. Done right, we can create jobs here, bring down the cost of electricity, radically reduce emissions from the energy sector and deliver lasting energy security. The potential to become a net exporter of electricity and green hydrogen to Europe also offers us a huge opportunity to raise significant revenue for reinvestment in climate action. I had the opportunity recently to travel to the Moray East offshore wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen alongside colleagues from the climate action committee. This wind farm alone will produce enough electricity to power 1 million homes. It is a remarkable feat of engineering and highlights the opportunity we have on this island to do the same.  However, we have had a lost decade of development in Ireland. Fine Gael took office back in 2011 and wasted a massive opportunity to spearhead the development of offshore wind over the subsequent ten years. While Scotland was literally laying the foundations, successive Governments here did nothing. There were no offshore auctions, no resourcing of our planning agencies, no port investment, no maritime area planning, no supply chain development, no apprenticeships; the list goes on. While I welcome the step change since the Minister took over, I am concerned the energy transition is not receiving the primacy of focus it requires. Issues around planning and ports, in particular, are still not being addressed. They are immediate pinch points for the sector and for the opportunities that present. Having raised the matter with the Tánaiste during Questions on Policy or Legislation this morning, I am not convinced the Government is taking it seriously enough or that it is receiving the requisite attention.  The industry has set out in stark terms what needs to be done to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind farms. It has warned that we will miss our 2030 targets if that delivery is not achieved. Unfortunately, I do not see a similar level of concern from the Minister. We need to see our planning agencies resourced properly to reduce the planning delays faced by offshore wind projects. We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects but we also need decisions to be made in a timely manner. The renewables industry has pointed out that the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks, and 69 weeks for strategic infrastructure developments, versus the statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks. This is evidence of a broken system that must be addressed if we are to deliver the scale of offshore wind required.  Last October, approval was given by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to An Bord Pleanála for an additional eight personnel for the planning authority's marine and climate unit. Despite this, by July of this year, just three of those posts had been filled. Others were not even advertised. This simply is not good enough.  Last month, we heard that just one port in Ireland, namely, Belfast, is capable of hosting the construction and installation of offshore wind farms. If we do not invest in and ready our ports now, we will lose the jobs and supply chain business from these multibilllion euro projects to ports in Britain. We will miss our renewables targets and our emissions reduction objectives. I note that the four Irish ports that applied for EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility were unsuccessful. This is concerning. The Government must step in to kick-start the investment that is required. We need particular and focused investment in Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Cork Dockyard. In addition, we need to invest in our electricity grid, develop our battery storage and green hydrogen sectors and reduce the cost of producing renewable energy here. These are the solutions to the problem in the longer term. I urge the Minister of State to prioritise addressing them.  Sinn Féin has been campaigning for years for our solar potential to be fully utilised. The International Energy Agency, IEA, has highlighted that in a period of just 90 minutes, enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's energy needs for a whole year. While solar energy is abundant, it represents a tiny fraction of Ireland's current energy mix. Sinn Féin published its Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill almost six years ago but little progress has been made since then to roll out solar energy in homes. We want to see solar photovoltaic, PV, panels installed on homes, businesses, schools, sports facilities, community buildings and farms across Ireland to help to cut our carbon emissions and deliver savings for citizens and communities. Installing an average-sized solar PV system on a home can generate 40% of the electricity needs of that household. This is particularly important given the massive electricity costs households now face. The MaREI Centre in Cork has found that solar panels could power a quarter of Irish households. I welcome the Government's solar for schools initiative and would like to see the detail on it.  Last month, Sinn Féin welcomed the long overdue publication of the energy security review. The report short-listed gas storage options of strategic floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, and strategic storage onshore or offshore. These options must be considered in the context of fossil fuel lock-in and ease of conversion to hydrogen or other low- or zero-carbon fuels. Commercial LNG is not short-listed, but is long-listed, due to the fact such a facility could result in the importation of fracked gas and could, furthermore, become a stranded asset. In regard to the notion of a stranded asset, I echo the call made repeatedly by my colleague, Senator Boylan, that Ireland needs to follow the example of the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Poland and probably France in leaving the Energy Charter Treaty. It is a bad deal that potentially will leave a significant burden on Irish taxpayers if we are left with these types of stranded assets. We have been expressing our concerns for some time about Ireland's lack of gas storage. Currently, 93.8% of the EU's gas storage is filled but Ireland does not have any such facility.  In the time remaining, it would be remiss of me not to refer to one of the other significant challenges facing Ireland We need a conversation on data centres. There has been a policy failure in this regard, including a failure in planning. We need a real discussion on how many data centres we can manage and what our fair share might be. Again, we have seen a developer-led approach rather than a plan-led approach. We must look at where these centres are located, whether they are providing district heating and how they are powered. They are putting huge pressure on the electricity grid and may potentially put huge pressure on the gas grid. They could be powered entirely by renewables if they were prescribed to do so. It could be a different story but it is not.  We need a clear focus on the McCarthy review into what has led us to this point. It is a failure of the Government to bring us to the brink of blackouts for a number of winters. That needs to be investigated. We have had representatives of the CRU before the Oireachtas climate committee, where they pointed to the failure of the T-4 auction. That needs to be investigated and the committee is going to do some work in this regard. There must be accountability. There are question marks over the Minister of the day, the Department, the CRU, EirGrid and others in the energy landscape in Ireland. We need accountability and lessons must be learned. The big opportunity is in renewables. There will be a transition to be managed and it must be done carefully and right.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-15 14:00:00+00:00	Science Week: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on statements on Science Week. I welcome the fact we are having this debate and that we have Science Week. It is a good opportunity for the House to address these issues that do not always get the focus they deserve. Of course, they are hugely important to our country and its future.  The theme this year was to explore the infinite possibilities of science to address social challenges and to help to understand our world. There are a couple of important points. This is about the idea of infinite possibilities and how you build a system that provides the necessary focus for the realisation of some of them. There are also issues around social challenges and understanding our world.  I welcome that the Minister placed an emphasis on climate in his contribution, which is what I will do in mine. We must think about the climate challenge as one that requires a scientific and technical response. When we speak about the sector, we have got into that habit of talking about sectoral ceilings and dealing with this issue on a sectoral basis, However, if we look at energy, transport, retrofitting or agriculture, for example, huge scientific advances in recent years have provided us with opportunities. I firmly believe we need to position ourselves as a country to lead in this field, whether it be in terms of energy or elsewhere.  Onshore wind technology has hugely advanced. Offshore technology is emerging but will advance in the time ahead. It is the same with solar energy. Our understanding has increased in the area of hydrogen in recent months and years. The opportunity there will depend on the efforts of the sector and the many scientists and technicians in the area, and likewise in the area of biofuels. In transport, new emerging battery technologies are increasing efficiency and effectiveness. We have sustainable aviation fuels. We are dealing with new building materials, progressing with retrofitting and installing new heating systems. In respect of agriculture, Teagasc appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action this morning to look at the whole range of research it is conducting in the area of land use. There is, therefore, almost exponential potential for our country. Within that, we must prioritise and maintain focus. It is important that we put the requisite resources and supports in place to encourage this. In science, we must build the environment to encourage the endeavour of individual scientists and as a collective. There must be incentives. We await the hydrogen strategy, for example. I welcome the fact that that ball is now rolling more quickly than it was heretofore.  Deputy Ó Laoghaire touched on the issue of basic versus applied science. As a country, we need to take risks in the area of scientific endeavour in terms of research and innovation. There is very often the constraint that the research that gets funded is that which will be commercial and deliver a return. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, we do not know what the technology is that will deliver for us and for climate; it may not exist yet. There is certainly an element within our response to climate change that is a moonshot. Our efforts are a statement of intent about doing the right things at this time to hopefully deliver the requisite responses in the years ahead. Some of that will be commercial; some of it will not.  I will make the point that we must take those risks. Sometimes, in some of these spaces, I quite often get the sense at either an institutional, governmental or departmental level that we are waiting to see what is happening in other countries. We cannot lead on everything but we need to be strategic and look at our strengths as a country, whether that is in terms of offshore energy, hydrogen, renewable technologies or whatever it may be and we need to be brave. We must support those who are working in those areas. It is really important that our research is open access and available, and that we support our scientists. Deputy Ó Laoghaire mentioned supports for student scientists and PhD students. I made the case previously for working scientists in the medical sciences and elsewhere. We must provide them with a wage, stipend or support to be able to live in the communities in which they work and study. There is significant opportunity for the institutions and states that are brave and ambitious at this time. The Minister mentioned climate, food and health. We have made significant progress in technology and IT, health sciences and life sciences. The green economy holds great potential. Some of the endeavour will be Betamax, some of it will be VHS, some of it will be neither. It is important that we enter into all of this with a spirit of support for the scientific effort. We should respect and support basic and social sciences as much as applied sciences. We should respect and support those who are supported by major pharmaceutical companies as much as we do pioneering local research in individual hospitals or third-level institutions. It is important to get the balance right.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-16 09:10:00+00:00	Energy Regulations: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to address this matter. The issue of electricity and energy affordability is central at this time. The motion points to the need to reform a broken market. That needs to happen, but we also need to address the cost of electricity and maximise State and community ownership of our national resources. That is not stated in the motion, but it should be.  The market is broken, and the Government has stood steadfast against reforms for far too long. Colleagues of mine here and at European level have advocated for market reform for many years. That became a very apparent necessity as far back as summer 2021. The Government, in October 2021, voted against proposals for reform. In June, the Minister of State said to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, that he did not think it was a good idea to reform the market or decouple the price of gas from that of electricity. On 11 August, the Minister for Finance said of decoupling the price of gas from that of electricity that such a windfall tax would undermine our energy independence. Essentially, it would undermine the profits of energy companies and impact on the amount they would have to reinvest. Countries that took a different approach, such as Spain and Portugal, were able to realise significant savings for electricity customers. The Government has been a barrier to that.  I welcome the U-turn, but it was a matter of a nod to the European Union and to the markets and of failing to be brave or act in the interests of the Irish people. That has happened time and again. It is the same in the context of the solidarity windfall tax and tackling the massive profits of Corrib Gas, for example. That is a Canadian company, and we talk about the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement. There are the massive profits of BP and Shell, €9 billion and €8 billion, respectively. The price of wind has not increased. The price of taking gas or oil out of the ground has not increased either, but the massive profits of these greedy companies have increased massively. They need to be tackled fast. My party has advocated for that for a long time.  The same goes at home in respect of the standing charge. The latter has been increased time and again, including by State-owned companies such as Electric Ireland and the ESB, without reason or explanation. The CRU tells us it does not have the legislative capacity to deal with that matter. This needs to be addressed.  Sinn Féin put forward a suite of proposals in a policy document, Vision for Renewable Energy, it launched this week. The answer for Ireland is energy independence in the form of renewables owned, as much as possible, by the State and local communities, generating jobs in the regions and stimulating local and export economies, in terms of every type of renewable and hydrogen. I will touch on a number of our proposals. We need to reform the public service obligation. That is the mechanism for funding renewables. It is a regressive levy in that it is flat and benefits large energy users because it is levied at peak demand rather than at average demand. We need to increase State investment in the forms of taxation and to incentivise and ensure communities can compete against corporations. We need a task force on the cost of renewables. Those costs are significantly lower than gas, as has been mentioned, but in Ireland those costs are greater than in other countries. That needs to be addressed. The Government has not done enough to protect people and needs to do it. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-23 09:10:00+00:00	Transport in Galway and Other Areas: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the motion and I thank the Independent Group. It chimes very well with the demands regarding the environment and climate and the needs of communities to deliver sustainable transport with a particular focus on public and active travel. There is growing recognition that we need system change rather than to push on individual behaviours. We need a scale of change that we have not seen previously. This requires the institutions of the State and its agencies to get their houses in order and have the focus and energy and strategy to deliver on systemic change.  I support the proposition that Galway act as a pilot. There is much in the motion pointing towards very sensible proposals on park and ride, rail and other mobility methods. The point made by Deputy Harkin is fair. There are principles that can be applied not only in Galway but throughout the State. In our alternative proposal Sinn Féin recognises there are significant opportunities for the State to lead and apply the principle of build-it-and-they-will-come and the principle that when public transport alternatives are there for people and they are accessible, affordable and reliable, people will use them. We do not have to imagine this as a scenario. We see it here and we certainly see it internationally.  We have called on the Government to take a number of measures to realise this. In our alternative budget we called for the reduction of 20% on fares to be made permanent and to extend that to commercial bus operators. We called for a public transport fare reduction of 50% for those aged under 18 and that fares would be made free for those aged under 18 over two years. We called for the expanded roll-out of Connecting Ireland. It is a good plan from the NTA that would see improved bus services for populations of more than 300. The funding commitment is not yet there from the Government. We know the targets for the first year, which is 2022, are being missed.  We have called for an extension of the short hop zones. These are particularly relevant in the commuter belt area around Dublin. We have called for investment in the western rail corridor and the Navan rail project, extending beyond what the Government is doing in the national development plan. These two critical pieces of rail infrastructure would deliver 2.375 million sustainable journeys on an annual basis. We have called for increased investment in accessibility for people with disabilities and increased investment in the public transport accessibility retrofit programme. There is a plan and there are particular challenges with our coach network. This needs to be advanced at a pace. We have called for a dedicated public transport policing unit to ensure people can feel safe on public transport, whether they be passengers or workers. We have called for increased investment in our school bus transport scheme services and fleet. This is to ensure school bus transport would be widely available, we would not refuse thousands of children every year and the buses would be up to standard.  I want to touch on how the principles and motion might apply to my county of Meath. We need investment in the Navan rail project. I know from the response to a parliamentary question that I received this morning from the NTA that the greater Dublin area transport strategy is with the Minister. He needs to sign off so the ball can get rolling on the Navan rail project. Funding needs to be allocated to the project. If Sinn Féin were in government, the project would start now and not after 2031 as the Government intends. We need an improvement in services in County Meath. In the past 24 hours, scores of people were waiting at bus stops for the 105X, 103 and NX. This is not acceptable and it needs to be addressed.  Connecting Ireland needs to be rolled out and expanded. Of course the hot topic of the day is incentives for people when the alternatives are not there. We have tolls in Meath, where there is a double toll on the M3. Drivers have to pay two tolls to get from Kells to Dublin. There is also a toll on the M1, which has an impact on the behaviour of drivers on that road. We have congestion every morning, which people will be familiar with if they listen to traffic reports. Kilmoon Cross is famous for traffic jams in part because traffic diverts off the M1 to avoid the toll. I call on the Minister of State to ensure the toll increases do not take effect at the start of January.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-29 14:00:00+00:00	COP27: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic. I also welcome these statements. I acknowledge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications for his work as EU ministerial representative at the loss and damage talks in Egypt. I thank the Irish officials whose work goes unseen but which was crucial to establishing a loss and damage fund.  Responding to the announcement of the fund, the climate change Minister of Pakistan, Ms Sherry Rehman, highlighted that the fund is not about some countries accepting charity but that it is down payment on an investment in our futures and climate justice. Her point about climate justice is really important.  Wealthier countries that account for just 12% of the global population are responsible for 50% of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years. Wealthier countries have contributed most to global warming. Many have built their economies and current national wealth on the back of considerable emissions. It is important that this be recognised and that funding be directed towards those countries that are now feeling the devastating consequences of global warming caused by these same emissions.  While the loss and damage fund was really positive, other aspects of COP27 were a significant disappointment. These included attempts to roll back on commitments made only one year ago at Glasgow and the inability to agree on strong language on the phasing out of fossil fuels - all fossil fuels. Advocacy group Global Witness highlighted that over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were in attendance at the climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh. That is even more than the number who attended in Glasgow last year. Their agenda is clear: to delay the transition from fossil fuels and greenwash ineffective actions in order to protect their profit and keep a business-as-usual approach for as long as they can. Fossil fuel lobbyists have no place at the UN conference. We would not invite big tobacco lobbyists to a lung cancer conference, so we should apply the same standard here. The interests of fossil fuel lobbyists do not align with efforts to cut our emissions radically. The lobbyists got a sympathetic ear in Egypt. Their exclusion in the future would be one step towards reforming the COP ahead of the next meeting, which is to take place in one of the biggest oil-producing countries in the world. It is vital that the public have confidence in the process and that it not be seen as a talking shop or circus. On the international stage, at European level, Ireland should be advocating the reform of the COP to ensure it is sufficient and effective and that it works.  If Ireland is to play its part in combating global warming, it needs a radical shift in the pace of delivery. We are almost midway through our first carbon budget but one would barely know that based on the action being taken. Instead of our emissions reducing by an average of 4.8% each year in the first cycle, they increased by 4.7% last year and will rise again this year. How are we supposed to meet the goal of a 51% cut by 2030 if we are this far off track now? Enormous cuts will be needed year on year at the end of this decade to make up for these lost years. In reality, the scale of those cuts, when required, will be such that they will be impossible to achieve in a single year.  I agree with the comments that Ms Marie Donnelly, the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, made at the sidelines of the COP to the effect that we need to tackle urgently some of the low-hanging fruit when cutting emissions here. In her comments, she specifically mentioned shallow retrofits, which we in Sinn Féin have been saying represent a considerable missed and available opportunity. Deep retrofitting is not happening at the scale required. The Minister's own figures show that. It is not credible to think that families across Ireland have a spare €30,000 to deep-retrofit their homes. I am not sure when the Government will realise that. Shallow retrofits and attic and cavity wall insulation are quick and affordable. In Sinn Féin's opinion, the State should be offering the full cost. Think of how many homes could be upgraded really quickly for a fraction of the price of a deep retrofit. It would deliver immediate carbon emissions reductions, help people save on their energy bills and improve health and well-being in the State's coldest homes.  The numbers for shallow retrofits have fallen off a cliff. In 2011, even at the height of the economic crisis, 51,577 attic insulations were carried out. In 2020 and 2021, similar to 2019, before Covid, the figure had dropped to below 5,000 annually, representing a full decade of missed opportunity. At that pace, it would take 100 years to complete the works on the 500,000 homes that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has said would benefit from attic and cavity wall insulation. Therefore, I asked the Minister to heed Ms Donnelly's comments and focus heavily on shallow retrofits in the time ahead.  Another issue that could be resolved quickly but that has not been to date is the under-resourcing of our planning system. The wind and solar industries have been banging this drum for some time. Some vital green-energy projects are caught in the system for far too long. Sinn Féin proposed in its alternative budget increased funding for our planning agencies and environmental NGOs to speed up planning applications. We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects and decisions to be made in a timely manner. The renewables industry said the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks. The average decision time for a strategic infrastructure development, SID, is 69 weeks, versus a statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks. We need more inspectors, ecologists and legal and administrative staff. Offshore projects to develop offshore windfarms need to put together environmental impact assessment reports as part of their applications, informed by fish and marine life surveys, marine mammal surveys and years of bird surveys. Environmental NGOs play an important role in this. Therefore increased funding for them would help them to contribute to complex planning applications to ensure we protect our biodiversity as we expand our energy production.  It is the same when it comes to our ports. Four Irish ports failed to secure EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility, but the State has not brought forward any alternatives. Belfast is the only port on the island currently capable of hosting the construction of offshore windfarms. If we do not invest and ready our ports now, we will lose jobs and supply chain business from multibillion euro projects to ports in Britain and elsewhere. Given the planning issues in ports, offshore wind experts I have spoken to are not confident that our 2030 target will be met and are mentioning 2035 more and more. I ask the Minister to assure the House that 2030 is still on target and there are plans to address the significant concerns around planning and port infrastructure. I mentioned foreshore licences, marine area consents and the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA. There are key timelines that need to be addressed.  Regarding transport emissions, Sinn Féin has proposed an increase of 10,000 places in the school transport scheme to harness the demand for the system and take thousands of cars off the roads every day. This has been inexplicably resisted to date. There is significant capacity to reduce our transport emissions if we provide the service. We have consistently argued with the National Transport Authority, NTA, about the need to reduce fares to encourage people to use public transport. It told us that was not the case and that we do not get the type of response indicated if fares are reduced. It said there is no clear correlation. We know now there is a clear correlation because we have empirical evidence, based on the impact of the 20% reduction in fares, which has seen significant increases in the uptake of public transport beyond what the NTA expected.  Separately, in terms of solar, farmers have asked about reforming the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant process to allow them to sell electricity to the grid and a change to the capital acquisition tax rules to encourage more solar on farms. Neither of those things has been considered. Farmers want to play their part but are not getting much co-operation in this area.  I refer to points made by the Minister at his party conference at the weekend when he discussed the increased ambition for solar energy, a doubling to 5 GW of the target included in the climate action plan and delivery five years ahead of what was originally scheduled. We keep having targets. It appears that, in the climate action plan there will be more targets, increased targets, shifting targets and a move away from electric vehicles, EVs, and offshore wind towards solar. We need delivery. We need the logistical or regulatory roadblocks and the planning and infrastructural barriers to be lifted. This needs to be a decade of delivery. That is what was demanded, not just at COP but at national level.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-29 14:00:00+00:00	Toll Charge Increases: Motion [Private Members]	1	I move: That Dáil Éireann: notes that: — there are 11 toll roads in operation across the State, 10 of which are on the national roads network with two of these being in full public ownership; — eight roads across the State are tolled under Public Private Partnerships (PPP); and — the Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the National Roads Programme; acknowledges that: — tolls on seven PPP roads and the M50 were increased at the start of 2022; — the announcement from Transport Infrastructure Ireland on 17th November, 2022, that tolls on eight PPP roads and the M50 will increase again from 1st January, 2023; — the Government has the ability to allocate funding to offset these toll increases; — the taxpayer has paid out millions of euros in traffic guarantee payments to private toll companies over the past three years, due to lower levels of traffic on our motorways as a result of the pandemic; and — some private toll companies have recorded millions of euros in after-tax profits in the past year; recognises that: — motorists are already struggling with very high fuel costs, and these toll increases will impact negatively on workers, both in the public and private sector, commuting to and from work each day; — the recent European Anti-Poverty Network report indicated that in this State, more than 17 per cent of people are living in enforced deprivation, and this represents an increase of over 100,000 people from 2021; — tolls particularly impact those living in rural areas, who are forced to use a private car due to the failure of successive Governments to put in place sustainable transport options; and — any increase in toll prices will add further to the cost-of-living crisis, the operating costs for businesses, including hauliers, and will result in higher prices for food and other goods and will put many businesses at risk; further acknowledges that: — the existing gold-plated PPP contracts that permit these toll increases, and generous traffic guarantee payments, are a legacy of bad economic policy choices and decisions made by successive Fianna Fáil-led administrations; and — the Minister of State at the Department of Transport with special responsibility for International and Road Transport and Logistics, Hildegarde Naughton TD, and Minister for Transport, Eamonn Ryan TD, were notified of the proposed planned toll increases in advance of Budget 2023 and the Government has failed to respond since; condemns: — the failure of the Government, in particular the Minister for Transport, Eamonn Ryan TD, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath TD, to respond and include the necessary financial provisions in Budget 2023, and to offset these planned increases and lessen the burden on workers, families, and businesses in the midst of the cost-of-living and fuel crisis; and  — Minister Eamon Ryan's disinterest in the plight of motorists, especially those involved in logistics and commercial activities; and mandates the Government to stop the proposed increase in toll charges planned for January 2023. I note the Government's eleventh-hour intervention where it has decided to defer the road toll increases for six months. It is clear as day that the Government has been bounced into this decision as a direct result of political and, probably more importantly, public pressure. There has been a huge public response to this crazy proposal. The Department of Transport was notified of these toll increases three full months ago, on 1 September, yet it took until today to get any action from the Government, just hours before this Sinn Féin motion calling on the toll increases to be stopped. As early as this morning it was being reported that a decision would not be made until closer to the new year. It is a welcome action but it does not go far enough.   The Government's announcement does not solve the problem. It only serves to kick the can down the road and it fails to provide the certainty required by families. It does not address the underlying problems. There seems to be no recognition whatever that we are living in a crippling cost-of-living crisis. Workers, hauliers and businesses are really struggling with transport costs. It is now proposed that the tolls will increase instead next summer, at a time when petrol and diesel prices have gone back up due to the expiration of the excise relief and just before the Government hikes fuel prices yet again with its annual carbon tax increase. This proposed toll increase will add €8 million to the operating costs of hauliers in the second half of 2023. It will heap additional costs on workers and families who have no alternatives.   In recent days I have been contacted by hauliers who are put to the pin of their collars. They have real concerns that their businesses will go to the wall. I have been contacted by people who have to travel for dialysis six times a week on a disability payment. The increasing cost of petrol and diesel and the obligation to make the commute through the tolls is putting them under severe financial pressure. It is completely unacceptable that the Government would let this situation get to this point.   The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan buried his head in the sand on this and simply hoped it would go away. He can show interest in toll roads an has in the past when it suited him. In opposition he called for electric vehicle, EV, owners to pay no tolls at all but when it comes to ordinary motorists, commercial operators or people driving a white van or a lorry who cannot afford an EV or do not have an EV option, he has no interest at all. This entire saga highlights how generous these gold-plated Fianna Fáil-era road toll contracts are and further, how poorly successive Governments since have invested in roads maintenance and upkeep. The public private partnership, PPP, contracts seem to be a win, win, win for the private contractor. The M3 operator made €11 million profit last year. That company gets paid millions if not enough cars use the road. Its tolls go up with inflation and the State is locked into these contracts for decades. It is a cash cow.   Earlier, I read a 2010 article in
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-29 14:00:00+00:00	Toll Charge Increases: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	1	"I thank all Members who contributed to the debate. It was important and timely and we saw some response from the Government on this issue. That response is late, however, and it does not go far enough. The Government knew as far back as early September that these proposed hikes were to come in in January. That is the time when a Minister for Transport who was in tune with the needs and lived experience of small business owners, of people driving vans trying to make ends meet, of commuters who get up early in the morning and get home late at night while working in the construction trades or wherever else, of haulage companies, for which he or she technically has responsibility and which would be faced with an €8 million bill if these proposed hikes came in, and of people who have to commute for dialysis, school, work or caring responsibilities in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when notified of these proposed increases, would have said ""No way"", that they could not proceed and that we had to find another way. That did not happen. The Minister has never, at any stage, said that. We have heard it from other Government party representatives and from other Government party leaders but we have never heard it from Deputy Ryan, the Minister with responsibility for the area. I welcome the fact that he is in the Chamber but we did not hear that from him even tonight.   In his deliberations, we heard that, whatever about the tolls, we knew where the money was not coming from. It was not coming from public transport or active travel and that, after that, it was somebody else's problem. It is the same tonight. In his contribution, the Minister pointed to measures the Government has taken. We support and have supported these measures and have prepared policy documents asking him to take different approaches and to go further with regard to public transport and active travel. We support such measures and our representatives will help deliver them in local communities. However, the Minister cannot ignore the fact that he has responsibility for the whole gamut of transport and that very many people have no alternative. They do not have the opportunity to switch to an electric vehicle, public transport or active travel. The Minister cannot ignore the plight of those people.   The fact that we have left it from 1 September until 29 November to act on this tells me that this is a Government and a Ministry that is not in tune with people's needs. As we speak, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII representatives are before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, scratching their heads and wondering whether they can get this done for 1 January because these are complex matters involving private contracts and a number of different parties. There is no guarantee and the mechanism will have to be negotiated. Without a shadow of a doubt, had TII been asked to do this on 1 September, it would have had a better chance of delivering it on 1 January. I encourage the Minister to take this motion and the debate tonight with him and to impress on the Department of Transport, on TII and on those profitable public private partnership, PPP, companies that they must ensure this measure is in place for 1 January.   However, as we have said, the Minister needs to go further than that. The period of six months is not long enough. During that time, I encourage the Minister to look at the funding mechanism for our national roads network. We have heard from TII that we invest approximately 2% of the value of our roads in their maintenance while 33% of this maintenance is dependent on tolls from the M50. That is the scheme we have built. It is based on PPP contracts and privatisation and represents a failure of Government to deliver on its responsibilities through general taxation. It is a failed model that is crucifying ordinary people and it needs to be addressed.   We also need a tolling scheme that incentivises the most efficient use of our roads. We have heavy goods vehicles and people in private cars avoiding the tolls by taking more minor roads, causing congestion. This is not an efficient use of our network and increases emissions, costs and congestion. It needs to be addressed and the Minister is responsible for doing that. I do not have confidence that he will but surely he has heard loud and clear from the commuting public that it needs to be done."

One of the central findings of the CervicalCheck scandal was showing up in lights the paternalistic nature of medicine and healthcare in Ireland. Ireland is not unique in that regard but we have a particular history, especially when it comes to women, poor people and people who are disadvantaged. In response to that, there are clear asks to address it. One of the things I took from the Scally report and this whole dreadful experience is there is a need for a culture shift. There is a need to address that information imbalance that exists between doctor and patient. It was at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal and how these women were failed.  The absence of the statutory duty of candour is a glaring omission that does not address the key issue at the heart of the scandal. The question of whether we can go further and do better must be asked. We all appreciate these are complex issues, that there are considerations, that no two cases are the same but after everything that has gone on, after all the dreadful experience, this is a unique opportunity and we in these Houses are uniquely placed to respond, to address those failings and to introduce legislation and a process that is fit for purpose and at its heart constantly shows people their information is their information. It is about saying that exchange or transaction, for want of a better word, between a person and their clinician is an equal transaction. The person is not a part of a broader system. Their sample, their cells, their biopsy or tissue material is not in a system for the sake of developing and improving a system but is instead a central part of that transaction between patient and doctor. At the heart of this is the need to ensure confidence in CervicalCheck. Central to the lack of confidence, or the hollowing out of confidence, is the experience of the scandal. Related to that was the decision to outsource cervical screening. I worked in our hospital laboratory system in advance of that decision. Through my role as a union representative, I , along with other medical scientists, could see clearly what was going to happen with cervical screening if it was outsourced. We also saw the motivation. It was a cost-saving exercise. Of course, the HSE had alternatives. It could have resourced cervical screening in Ireland but it did not. It was part of a broader strategy. At the time, we invited those private laboratories that we outsourced cervical screening to into Ireland. It was not just cervical screening that our Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government wanted to give them. It wanted to give them hospital and GP diagnostics as well. They now have facilities out on the M50. They did not come here to do private testing; they came to do public testing, and a Fianna Fáil-PD Government wanted to give it to them. It outsourced cervical screening, with detrimental impacts. Thankfully, thanks to the efforts of union representatives and workers, it did not outsource the public and GP work.  We need to re-establish confidence in the cervical screening programme by investing in and resourcing our laboratories. We need to repatriate cervical screening and bring it back. We need to do it in accredited labs. I recall the shock when people learned that many of the labs that cervical screening was outsourced to, and subsequently outsourced from the outsourced laboratories, were not accredited, but many of the laboratories in Ireland are accredited only on a voluntary basis. They are not supported or resourced adequately to be accredited. That needs to be addressed. We need to train up cytologists and we need to bring that work back to Ireland to give people confidence in it. We also need to establish this legislation and the process, to ensure that women can have confidence in the process so they know that when their cells and samples are in the system that they will have as much access to the information as their clinicians. To do that, we need a clear statutory duty of candour in the Bill.

I welcome that there seems to be some movement on the part of the Minister but the devil will be in the detail. Programmatic audits are not a new concept in the HSE or elsewhere. The question is what those programmatic audits trigger. When individual errors or issues are identified, what does that trigger? We need to be careful to recognise that these audit processes are not a new concept. They have been designed and used for the development of learning organisations, and for the improvement of systems, screening programmes or whatever else it may be, but we want a cultural change here. We want to ensure that at the heart of those system decisions is a recognition that there is a human there - a patient who is an individual - and it is her information as much as it is the learning system's information.  There is work to be done. It would be some progress to see an automatic need to notify people but we need to stress-test that with those people who have direct dreadful experience of the existing system. I hope the Minister will be open to that type of discussion in the time ahead.

The flight paths that are being operated are not the ones that were agreed. Houses were insulated to mitigate against the noise of low-flying planes. Incredibly, many of those homes are not now on the flight path, while hundreds of others, as well as schools and businesses which were never insulated, have to live with the noise nuisance of low-flying planes for hours each day. This appears to be a spectacular error by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, the IAA, and by Fingal County Council who have responsibility here. What measures is the Government taking to address this? Will the Tánaiste ensure that the DAA is not allowed to operate contrary to its permissions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-12-13 14:00:00+00:00	Current Issues Affecting the Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sinn Féin motion. I commend Deputy Cullinane on bringing it forward. We have recruitment and retention challenges across our health service, and this Government, like previous ones, has not done enough to address them. The motion states that there is a widely held belief among the public that the current Minister is incapable of addressing the crisis in our health service and, along with the wider Government, has been making the situation worse. That statement is true.  It is truer of the delivery of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath, than anywhere else. Government policy, as stated in the small hospitals framework document of 2013, is to close the Navan accident and emergency department and to downgrade the hospital to a model 2 hospital. The Minister has been made aware repeatedly of concerns about the safety of critically ill, unstable patients presenting at the Navan accident and emergency department. To state them clearly, however, those safety concerns are directly related to a chronic under-resourcing of acute and emergency services at Navan. For years staff were not recruited and not retained. Acute and emergency services were allowed by design to drift into a situation of precarity. Given the population of Meath, given the demand for emergency services in Meath from the people of Meath, given the physical distance to the next nearest emergency department, and given the state of overcrowding in those same emergency departments, there are no spare beds, no spare trolleys and no spare chairs. Adults are left waiting in the back of an ambulance, in a car park. Sick children have it even worse. They are sent out with their parents to wait in the car. It is not a situation that should be allowed to proceed.  Incredibly, despite the protestations of clinicians working on the front line - the repeated protestations of 17 consultants, to be exact - tomorrow morning a bypass protocol will be introduced at Navan and will mark the next step in the diminution of services at Navan and a step closer to the closure of the accident and emergency department there. What of those protestations? Will they say, as the motion states, that this Minister's approach and that of the Government will make matters worse? They state clearly and repeatedly that the Government's proposals and the HSE's plan will lead to worse clinical outcomes and will put lives at risk. They point to the HSE's track record in the region: repeated promises but failure to deliver. They point specifically to a bypass protocol and the fact that there are still no full-time consultants in neurology, stroke or rheumatology. As a result, the experience of the health professionals in our region, at both Navan and Drogheda hospitals, is a negative one of repeated promises but changes implemented without the necessary staffing, capacity or additional resources for our health services. The plan for Navan hospital must be one of investment and bringing it to a standard to ensure it is safe for the people of County Meath. The county has a population of in excess of 220,000 people. We know a review has been on the Minister's desk for two months at this stage. We have been very critical of its terms of reference, as the Minister knows well, but it is completely unacceptable to transfer risk from one hospital to another. Investment must be made to ensure that services are safe at Drogheda and Navan hospitals. That is the plan that must be presented and introduced. Anything other than that is a failure in my opinion.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-12-14 09:00:00+00:00	Nationalisation of Energy System: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for tabling this motion. It gives us an opportunity to highlight how broken our electricity system is and how the privatisation and marketisation of it has failed our citizens. The failures of energy liberalisation are now widely accepted, but often not in the corridors are power. These failures are exemplified by the decline in the social value, affordability and security of our energy resources following the privatisation of our energy system. The ESB, our principal State-owned energy company, was instrumental in building that system while maintaining energy affordability. Moreover, the extent of the ESB's market share ensured the profits from energy generation in the State were heavily invested in public services for the population. Throughout the liberalisation programme, the ESB went from owning and operating 96% of the installed generation capacity in 2001 to 51%. It now holds a mere 33% share of generation in the all-island market. The systematic sell-off of our national assets was presented as an EU requirement and a means of developing more affordable electricity, neither of which was remotely true.  The pace and scale of this State’s privatisation agenda was unmatched by our European counterparts. The market share of France’s state-owned EDF reduced by a mere 6% to 83% while Sweden increased the market share of its largest generator by more than 20%. In the same timeframe, we went from having among the lowest electricity prices in Europe to the highest. Between 2000 and 2020, household electricity prices, excluding taxes and levies, increased by 274%. Additionally, the market share transfer from the State to the private sector has meant more profits from energy generation have flown into corporate dividends instead of public services and critical infrastructure.  Sinn Féin recognises that the ESB and other State bodies are central to our economic, social and environmental goals. In 2011, our finance spokesperson, Deputy Doherty, tabled a motion rejecting the privatisation of the ESB and recognising its importance to the future security and prosperity of the economy and society and to the environmental protection of the island. Unfortunately, it was not accepted and at great public cost. While we cannot turn back time, the energy transition presents an opportunity to rewire our energy system fundamentally into a more prosperous and democratic one that serves the common good.  We should not be surprised by the Minister's amendment. It is from a Government which has opposed market reforms and actively supported the current market system for an extended period. When all and sundry recognised the failures of the market, the Government, supported keenly by the Green Party, ensured reform was delayed and argued against it. As recently as August of this year, the Minister for Finance said the decoupling of gas from electricity prices would undermine investment in renewable energy and our energy transition. Of course he meant it would undermine the private profits of companies on which the Government’s idea of energy transition is fundamentally built.  We have great State agencies, such as the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna, which are in a position, if empowered, to lead our energy transformation. Sinn Féin has set out a suite of proposals to empower those agencies to do that but they are not in a position to do it because of the Government’s commitment to the market. Over the years it has driven up energy prices and created false economies at the expense of consumers. The Government has a proven track record of supporting a false system and needs to reverse that.

I am sharing time with Deputy Cronin. I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Cost of Renewables Taskforce Bill 2022 to the Dáil today. The Bill is important and would have significant implications for the cost of electricity for people. Its simple aim is to quickly establish a cross-departmental taskforce to examine the high costs of producing renewable energy here and to bring forward recommendations on ways to reduce this cost per megawatt hour. As we strive to reach 80% renewable energy generation by 2030, it is essential that the cost of producing this green electricity comes down. In our latest renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction wind energy cleared at almost €98 per megawatt hour. In other European countries prices are in the €50 range and in Spain it is even in approximately €20 per megawatt hour. Instead of coming down towards the European average, the costs in Ireland have gone up in the latest RESS auction. We need to reverse this trend and cut the cost of producing renewable energy here both to reduce household bills and to ensure Ireland is competitive to export wind energy and green hydrogen to Europe.  Delays in the planning system, the design of the auctions, commercial rates and grid connection costs are all pushing up the price of power in Ireland. The aim of this taskforce is to identify all of these contributing factors and to bring forward recommendations looking at international best practice on how to reduce the cost of producing green energy per megawatt hour.  Importantly, this Bill also mandates the taskforce to recommend mechanisms to ensure any savings made on the cost of producing renewable energy are passed onto consumers. Our transition to a zero-carbon energy system must benefit the climate and all of our citizens.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-18 12:00:00+00:00	Climate Action Plan 2023: Statements	1	I am sharing time with Deputy Cronin. I will take ten minutes and she will take five.  I welcome the opportunity afforded by these statements. I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that this is a new project, coming on the back of the sectoral emissions ceilings and the first climate action plan. It is based on documents published a couple of days before Christmas. We have not yet got the annex of actions. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is a better way to bring this forward or a better timeline in which this would not be discussed so close to Christmas and in which we would have the annexe of actions at the earliest opportunity. We have not received a hard copy of the climate action plan yet. I accept that this is a relatively new process. If there is an opportunity to improve on it, as I believe there is, let us do so.  In saying that, I acknowledge that the climate action plan itself and the annexe of actions provide a strong framework for documenting the exact measures that will be taken by Government. Whether we agree with them is a different question but they do document the measures and allow those of us in the Opposition to hold the Government to account in respect of them. I acknowledge that.  The Minister has said we are going in the wrong direction globally. We are also going in the wrong direction in Ireland as regards emissions reductions. In fact, we are not realising emissions reductions; our emissions are increasing. As time goes by, we are eating further and further into the time period of our carbon budgets and into the emissions ceilings they provide. If we continue on our current trajectory, there is a real risk that we will max out or exhaust our first carbon budget well in advance of 2025. There is significant detail in the climate action plan and a ten-minute statement will not address all of it. I will break it down into a number of areas. There is broad political consensus as regards the ambition. That is set out in the science. There is a great level of detail in the action plan and a ten-minute statement is not going to address all of it. I will break it down into several areas. There is broad political consensus regarding the ambition and this is set out in the science. There are many areas where I and my party would be critical in saying we are moving too slowly. The path in some areas we can contest, while in other areas the path is quite clear but we are moving too slowly. I will touch on some of these areas in respect of renewables. In other areas, retrofitting, for example, I will contend that we are on the wrong path and our schemes are designed incorrectly. It is the same with electric vehicles, EVs. We accept the targets and want to meet them, but the path designed by the Government is not the correct one. It is acknowledged by everybody that there is a real need for additional quality information in several areas, including land use and agriculture. Regarding the financial end of this, work is being done in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. Let us make that happen as quickly as possible.  A point that I have made to the Minister before is that I see there is a move in respect of the governance structure and accountability and new mechanisms within the Department of the Taoiseach. The Minister needs to continue to push that. There is a need for accountability within the Department of the Taoiseach but also within the individual Departments. We have seen this at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action where we have struggled to get responses and engagement from individual Departments. It is frustrating and my concern is that it shows a lack of priority in this regard within those Departments.  There needs to be an absolute focus, not by 2030 but by the end of the year. Sinn Féin published its vision for renewable energy and outlined a number of measures that need to be taken. There needs to be increased ambition regarding the proportion of community, State-owned and domestic renewables. We must empower our strong State agencies. It is great to have them. We must empower communities. We must see the guidelines updated that have been on the books for far too long. If we are to deliver on the ambition for onshore and offshore wind, we need to have community buy-in. We can achieve this if we take a particular approach. We need investment in ports, the grid and the planning system. I raise this point with the Minister regularly and I am sure he is aware of it but we need an identified workforce plan. I understand An Bord Pleanála has come forward with that. Is it up to scratch? Are those people in place? Will they be in place to deliver and assess the applications coming the Minister's way?  We need reform of the public service obligation, PSO. It is regressive between large energy users and residential energy users and also between residential energy users. The PSO needs to be reformed to ensure fairness. On retrofitting, we have published a policy and had a Dáil debate on this issue. The Minister is not taking on board the points made by me and others in the Opposition. We and the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCPC, have stated that shallow retrofit need to be introduced at pace. Up to 500,000 homes would benefit from shallow retrofits today. Far too many people cannot access schemes because they are not eligible for them or do not have the money to do so.   I appreciate that we need to scale up in respect of capacity. The Government needs to ensure the resources are applied in the most efficient and effective way possible. Sinn Féin has set out our proposals in A Fairer Retrofit Plan, which looks at taking an area-based approach. This area-based approach has been employed and I have heard that Fingal County Council has sought for it to be standard practice. In the better energy communities scheme, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has employed it, almost on a pilot basis, in Cork. This is the approach we need to take. We must identify the coldest and poorest households and retrofit those along with neighbouring homes to allow us to get through as many houses as possible, rather than retrofitting Nos. 6, 11 and 14 in one street this month and then doing Nos. 5 and 8 six months later, with everybody in between left behind. There is a possibility and need to take a fairer and more efficient approach.   Lifting people out of energy poverty is also a key priority. While I welcome the movement on the energy poverty strategy, it needs to happen at pace. It is the same with solar power. There is a great opportunity in this area. As I understand it, however, some energy providers are still not getting paid for the energy they are giving back to the system. This needs to be addressed. Again, it is an example of where the Government and the Opposition are on the same page. Why is this not happening in a timely fashion to show people the benefits and opportunities of climate action?  Regarding transport, there are great opportunities in the Connecting Ireland plan. I ask the Minister to please prioritise and resource this plan. A sum of €5 million was allocated in its first year. Sinn Féin has committed to allocating €25 million to it in year two. Let us make that happen. I have seen it implemented through the introduction of the 188 bus service. This is a route I have argued for since before I was a Teachta Dála and while still a county councillor. It has been welcomed by the community. Let us make more of this happen. This development is in stark contrast to the Navan rail line, which we are again hearing will not be delivered until 2036. That is far too slow. Communities want this rail line and will appreciate it. It would be a very positive development in the context of climate action. Let us make it happen.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-18 12:00:00+00:00	Oil Emergency Contingency and Transfer of Renewable Transport Fuels Functions Bill 2023: Second Stage	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill this afternoon. I will share time with my colleagues. It is a 20-minute slot. I will take ten minutes and allow five minutes each for Deputies Cronin and Martin Browne.  I regret that the Minister is ushering through yet another Bill at breakneck speed without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. This method is becoming the norm for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. For example, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board Bill was rushed through, as was the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022. The EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 was also hurried through the Dáil and did not undergo any prelegislative scrutiny. In addition, both electricity credit Bills were brought through the Houses at speed. The Minister seems to be setting aside long-standing parliamentary process and scrutiny and ramming through legislation that has undergone very little prior examination by Deputies and Senators. An absence of prelegislative scrutiny combined with guillotined debates from this Government is a recipe for disaster. Rushing legislation can lead to bad legislation. I put on record our concern about this regular approach from the Minister.  Here we are again today, on the first day after a four-week recess, with another Bill that has not undergone prelegislative scrutiny by the climate committee, which the Government intends to ram through all Stages in a matter of weeks. This Bill would confer significant additional powers on the Minister that relate to an essential commodity that everyone in the State needs to heat their homes or power their vehicles. Section 31, nestled neatly in the last line of the Bill, seeks to confer on the Minister the power to “regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of the type or types of fuel”. That one sentence is extremely wide-ranging and would have major consequences for individuals, households, businesses and the economy. It bestows great power on one Minister. Whether we like it or not, oil remains an absolutely essential commodity so any emergency powers relating to its control and supply need to be carefully considered. Because it has not been examined in detail and the consequences have not been teased out, Sinn Féin will be submitting amendments to the Bill, one of which would require the Minister to seek Dáil approval to regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of a fuel. Sinn Féin will not be writing blank cheques for this Minister.  It is important to ask why exactly we are here. We are living in extraordinary times due to the war in Ukraine and the impact it has had on our fuel supplies and their prices. It is important to respond to that. The Government will seek to lay the entire blame on the war but that is simply not the full picture. This State remains heavily reliant on imported oil due to the failure of successive Government policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating. Over the past decade, successive governments failed to realise our potential for offshore wind power. Not one offshore wind turbine was constructed during their tenure in government. While countries like Scotland were literally laying the foundations of massive offshore wind farms, successive administrations here simply sat on their hands. I visited a Scottish wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen last year. That project alone will power 1 million homes. There is absolutely no reason Ireland could not be in the same position right now. Indeed, we should be further ahead given our extensive revenue-raising ability compared with Scotland but a lack of action and ambition over the past decade has left us trailing behind. As a result, we are reliant on imported gas and oil to keep the lights on. That is one reason the Minister is seeking these additional powers here today.  The slow pace of change to electric vehicles is another reason. Other countries, like Norway, have powered ahead with their transition to electric vehicles, EVs. For years now, Sinn Féin has being calling for alternative policies to be introduced to help to speed up the transition to EVs but these calls have not been heeded. We called for a second-hand EV grant to be introduced to help ordinary people to afford an EV, such as been done in other countries. This has been ignored. We suggested that increased grants for lower income households could be looked at. This suggestion was not taken up. We also called for the VAT and customs costs that are in place as a result of Brexit to be removed to encourage the importation of used EVs from Britain, which has, in the past, been a significant market for the importation of used cars. That was not, however, looked at. Building a second-hand EV market is important to make EVs accessible to more people on normal incomes. All three of these initiatives could be funded through reform of the existing grant scheme, which has a budget of €100 million. Reducing the value threshold of cars that qualify for grant aid, for example, would free up tens of millions of euro to be redirected to these more equitable policies, but instead the Government has been handing out grants of €5,000 to people who do not need financial help, supporting the purchase of expensive sports cars and luxury EVs and boosting the egos of multibillionaires who run many of these companies. No help or assistance has been provided to ordinary people to help them to afford an EV; quite the opposite. They are the ones who have been punished by the Government's carbon tax. It is a perfect example of the Government’s wider approach to climate action. EVs make up 20% of all cars in Norway now. In Ireland, this number is just 2.7% according to statistics from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. This is another reason the Government is seeking these emergency powers on the distribution of fuel. Its policies on EVs have failed dramatically and left us with a tiny proportion of EVs on our roads and therefore heavily reliant on imported oil, which history will tell us is a volatile commodity. We did not need to wait for the war in Ukraine to learn that.  The same can be said regarding getting people out of their private cars and onto public transport. I raised this point with the Minister earlier concerning the need to invest significantly in the rural transport plan to ensure that communities that do not have bus services get such services and that the services in those communities that have them are improved and made affordable, accessible, reliable and safe. Let us look at the Connecting Ireland plan. The scale of funding required is not there. It needs to be increased. As I said to the Minister earlier, Sinn Féin would commit €25 million to that plan in 2023. This would ensure a significant increase in the roll-out and would mean that in 2024, if the funding was matched again, the full plan would be rolled out. This would deliver significantly increased services and present people with the realistic option of leaving their cars behind. A two-car family could become a one-car family. The daily commute could be broken up, being done some days by car and other days by public transport. People will not, however, do this when they do not have that option. Another reason we are here and we are so dependent on oil and liquid fuels is because of a failure to roll out public transport.  The same can be said when it comes to residential heating. Homes across Ireland are still reliant on burning oil to keep warm, because the Government's retrofitting plan has and is bypassing them. These households cannot afford to upgrade their heating systems, as the Government's retrofitting plan is inequitable and inaccessible. Over the past decade, shallow retrofits fell by 88%, resulting in lost heat and a higher demand for oil to keep warm. Failed policies on retrofitting mean burning oil to keep warm is still a reality for far too many people, and this further increases our reliance on imported fuels. While the war in Ukraine might be the handiest excuse to hand for the Minister, in reality failed policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating have all contributed to our massive reliance on imported oil and left this State and our people worryingly exposed to imported fuel. We need policy change in the area of offshore wind in order to accelerate it and this must involve widespread State ownership. We need policy change with regard to EVs to support ordinary people, with regard to residential heating to have a fair and equitable retrofitting plan and with regard to public transport to ensure people have access to such transport. In terms of more sustainable residential heating systems, Sinn Féin has asked the Minister to explore the use of hydrotreated vegetable oil, or HVO, as a cleaner alternative for home heating. HVO, which can be used in traditional home heating oil boilers, cuts emissions by between 80% and 90% compared to home heating oil.   We will submit amendments to this Bill and continue to engage with this process. We have concerns regarding this legislation. We recognise that it is necessary but there is much more than can and should be done.

It is a bad deal for Ireland because it will increase the price of land. More importantly, it reflects a complete lack of vision on behalf of the Government. There is no strategy. Forget about strategy; there is a lack of vision. There is an opportunity here to bring communities with us and what is the Government doing instead? It is isolating them and alienating them. It is completely unacceptable but it is no surprise at all, given there is a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and their ideological partners in the Green Party.  Communities are being isolated. Farmers are being isolated. The price of land is being driven up. There is a real opportunity in forestry, and the Government does not have to imagine where communities are, because there has been a Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity Loss. The Department has consulted with communities. It has spelled it out in the public attitudes presented in the survey on forestry. Communities want to play their part. They want forestry in urban and rural areas. They want it to be alive. They want a richness in biodiversity. Instead, what are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party doing? They are selling it off for corporate profit and shame on them all. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-25 09:10:00+00:00	Communications Regulation Bill 2022: Instruction to Committee	1	I will share time with Deputy Ó Murchú. I welcome this motion and thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward. We will have an opportunity later on Report Stage to have further discussion on it. I commend those involved on getting us to this point. This has been a particular focus of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications. There have been numerous debates in this House over the last number of years regarding the future viability and sustainability of our post office network. I commend the Ministers and the Departments, particularly the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, and their representatives, who engaged with representatives across the political spectrum in a range of forums and put their case strongly and clearly forward regarding what they saw as needed to ensure the viability of the network.  In other areas, issues came up during debates and were raised by representative groups and An Post regarding offline services. There was an inter-departmental review. Enough is not coming from that as regards offline services. I support the proposition that there is significant opportunity for An Post and post offices to deliver offline services. This is particularly the case in the area of ID verification. The post office service has the technology, the physical footprint in the communities the length and breadth of Ireland and there remains significant opportunity in those areas.  My colleague will pick up on more recent developments in respect of the price of stamps and other matters but I will conclude by saying that I welcome the motion, look forward to the debate later on, and more importantly, look forward to this funding being distributed to the post office network in a fair manner to ensure the viability of it. That will be matter which will need constant review, update and engagement because the post office network is of great importance to communities for so many reasons.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2023-01-26 08:50:00+00:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	The Minister, in response to my colleague, Deputy Doherty, earlier, said he wants to smash the housing targets. I am not sure whether he has told the Office of the Planning Regulator about that or amended the national planning framework or told a single local authority in the State. In Meath, we have a track record of delivering houses but there are nowhere near enough. The Meath County Council housing delivery action plan targets are shy by 2,000 out to 2027 and there will be more people going onto the housing list than houses being built. To buy a house in the private market, people are looking at in excess of €485,000 for a three-bedroom property. We are ahead of the game in regard to our county development plan but as soon as it was adopted, it was out of date because it was based on the 2016 census figures and population projections that were grossly underestimated, although they were the basis for the national planning framework, NPF. For example, the town of Dunshaughlin could grow by 6,000 people up to 2027 and there are 8,500 people there already. Will the Minister immediately review the housing targets for County Meath and ensure they are consistent with national, regional and local plans?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-26 08:50:00+00:00	Forestry Strategy: Statements	1	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this subject again. I also spoke during Sinn Féin's Private Members' motion, which made three concrete proposals. Deputy Carthy has touched on a number of them, those being, licensing and how the State can get itself off the hook in the Coillte deal. In my comments, I will focus on the forestry strategy.  Sinn Féin's Private Members' business called for the publication of a forestry strategy as a matter of urgency and for it to prioritise afforestation undertaken by local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures, which is the model of delivery that should be at the strategy's heart. In his concluding remarks, the Minister referred to the Government's approach and said: The second part is that we publish our new forest strategy as soon as possible, and an ambitious one. This is what we will be doing. We are working on finalising that at the moment and it will be a really good forestry strategy to go with the unprecedented high premium rate that we already announced just before Christmas. There was no mention of the delivery mechanism or the prioritisation of local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures. That should come as no surprise.  There is agreement that we need an ambitious plan for forestry, but the Government seems to be ignoring it, which is the disappointing element. There is an agreed vision of what the future of forestry should look like. Indeed, the Department conducted an extensive public consultation using surveys, various deliberative models and stakeholder engagement, and prepared a summary report of the result. What does the citizenry say when we speak to it about the future of forestry? There is a wisdom in crowds, as there always is. Regarding Ireland's ambition for forest creation, and according to the report, citizens recognise: 1. The current level of forest cover in Ireland is too low and there is an urgent need for a greater level of ambition. 2. Ireland needs a major expansion of new forests, to where there is a greater balance with traditional agriculture in the landscape. 3. Land availability is a critical element to any future increase in forest cover. 4. A significant shift in land use change is needed and will require much better integration of trees and forests with traditional farming and agricultural practices. 5. There needs to be a regulatory system in place that can deal efficiently and effectively with the requirements of forest establishment and management. 
             1. Climate change is a key driver for increasing forest cover. 2. Combating climate change should be a priority objective when planning new and managing existing forests. 3. Forest carbon accounting will be a key tool to understanding the climate change impact of the forest sector and to informing decisions on future land use planning, 4. Increasing the use of wood and wood products, both as a long-term store of carbon and as a substitute to using more carbon intensive products are key ways that forests can contribute to meeting our climate targets. 5. There is a preference [among the citizenry] for managing forests in a way that addresses climate change. People want forests in urban and rural areas. According to the report: 1. There is generally a very positive attitude toward forests in Ireland and they are an important natural resource for urban and rural communities, using them regularly for recreation and health and wellbeing [sic]. 2. Continued access to public forests is vital to maintain the benefits of forests to people. There is a general divergence in preference for access to publicly or privately owned forests ... 5. Continued and improved engagement and communication with forest owners and farmers is essential to maintaining good working relationships and building confidence and trust. I have more to go through, but it already seems that if the Department, Minister and Minister of State actually listened to the public consultation that they conducted, they would not have landed themselves where they are.  The consultation continues: 2. There is a preference to see more wood products used in the construction of Irish houses an in energy generation ... 5. There is a need for wider education and awareness raising on the benefits of wood and timber products. Using forests for nature shows a major gap in the Government's approach. The consultation reads: 1. Supporting and protecting nature and biodiversity are key drivers for increasing forest cover and planning and managing existing forests. 2. There is a preference for expanding, enhancing and restoring native woodland habitats. 3. Establishing non-native conifer forests on sensitive peatland habitats is a key concern. The existing biodiversity and climate mitigation value of candidate afforestation sites should be an important consideration in this regard. 4. A diversity of approaches to forest establishment and management should be used in support of nature ... 
             1. There is a preference among the public for more diverse mixed forests and native forests. 2. The urgent need to create more forests should not be used as a reason to continue planting less diverse forests ... 
             1. People would like to see more forests established on a mix of private and public lands and in urban and near-urban areas ... 
             2. There is an interest at community level to facilitate greater community involvement in forest establishment and management ... 4. Using a suite of options in encouraging more farmers to plant trees will be important. Nowhere in the above did the citizenry say that we should develop a complex market mechanism and use investment funds to buy up tranches of private land to deliver corporate profit. Rather, the people have said that they want a model of forestry that delivers for local communities, the environment, farmers and the economy. Indeed, this is the same sentiment that came from the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss last week. The Government has landed somewhere entirely different, though.  There has been extensive discussion of the Coillte deal, which is a bad deal for Ireland. Today in the  [The commission] has previously drawn attention to risks of inappropriate afforestation of sensitive habitats such as peatlands and negative effects on areas of high ecological value ... I will draw a connection. When the Government consulted the people of Ireland, they said exactly the same thing as the European Commission did. The  The [strategic environmental assessment] report also does not ... adequately address concerns about the piecemeal encroachment of forestry plantations and roads into open landscapes under high natural value farming and relied upon by open habitat birds, notably the hen harrier and the breeding curlew. Breeding curlew numbers have collapsed from an estimated 3,300-5,500 pairs in the late 1980s to no more than 150 pairs at present. There is an agreed vision - my party certainly reflects it - in the report of the public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. The Government is failing miserably to deliver on it."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-02-15 09:12:00+00:00	Energy Costs and Windfall Taxes: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the motion and the specific proposals to introduce targeted price caps and a windfall tax, review the proposed revenues from non gas and electricity generators and leave the Energy Charter Treaty. Sinn Féin has advocated an energy price freeze for some months. It is welcome that the Social Democrats support that move. It would provide certainty and the maximum protection for consumers. Coupled with a windfall tax, it is the most effective way to tackle the disgusting profits and practices of big energy companies.  An energy price break has been introduced in several EU member states. Over the Christmas break, energy price caps for 2023 were introduced in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in Austria, France, Luxembourg and Poland. The question of it undermining conservation could easily be addressed in a number of ways such as, for example, applying the price break only to average household electricity consumption or a household's consumption the previous year, as is the case in the design of the scheme in Germany.  The Government will not oppose the motion, but has no intention of introducing an energy price cap because, time and again, when push comes to shove and action is measured over spin, it will protect the profits of big energy companies. After all, it was the greatest opponent of energy windfall taxes despite the fact that Shell announced $40 billion in profit last year, the highest in 115 years. BP announced profits of $28 billion and Exxon Mobil profits of $56 billion. Closer to home, Vermilion, the operators of Corrib gas, made $102 million in one quarter. They are eye-watering figures. While hiking charges for ordinary customers Centrica, or Bord Gáis, said its earnings in 2022 will be eight times its 2021 earnings. Energia increased its profits by 50% in 2022. ESB made €390 million in the first six months of last year. This is simply obscene.  The Government opposed market reforms as a European level. When the EU toolbox provided for price caps and windfall taxes as far back as October 2020, the Government stood steadfast in opposition to it. In June 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said it was the wrong move. In August 2022, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said windfall taxes would undermine Irish energy independence. Such is the paucity of vision from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party that they could not see that and act on behalf of ordinary consumers. Instead, they are eventually brought kicking and screaming when the European Union moves. That is a feature of every intervention the Government makes. It is the last one to move in the European Union. It will not lead; it will follow and resist positive proposals.

I will read the Minister's words back to him. He said if a decision is made for a co-ordinated exit of EU member states from the treaty, Ireland will support that position and withdraw. It is the same in respect of windfall taxes. While the Iberian countries of Spain and Portugal moved, the Government resisted that. Today, instead of delivering €1.9 billion, he has told us the windfall tax will deliver €280 million because of his delay.

There is some concern that the shift in focus towards public transport will have a detrimental impact on a number of earmarked road projects. What is his response to that concern? I want to flag some important road projects in my area, one of which is that between Kilmoon Cross and the Rath roundabout. Despite being in level 5 lockdown, traffic volumes in the area are at 85% of pre-Covid levels. I have spoken to engineers and transport officials in Meath County Council who have analysed this project at length. What they propose will have active traffic measures and will tick a number of boxes in terms of the national strategic objectives. There are concerns that the shift in focus will deprioritise projects such as this. I emphasise the importance of the Navan rail project, an issue I have raised previously with the Minister, and of the Slane bypass. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on those projects.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action earlier, we heard from a number of witnesses, some of whom raised the need for a change in governance structures, suggesting there may be an opportunity to review the roles of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. Are our current structures are fit for purpose? Is the NTA sufficiently resourced to deliver on the ambitious programme of work the Government has for it? Does the Minister have plans to address that?

Is the Minister confident the NDP will deliver on the ambitious target of a 51% emissions reduction? I presume the transport sector will be expected to do its fair share of lifting in that regard, given it is a considerable contributor to emissions.

Regarding the Minister of State's amendment No. 107, a number of alternative formulas of words were put forward and, I think, ruled out of order. I am not sure whether this has been considered or whether the Minister of State has a perspective on it. I think the formula the Minister of State has come up with is a first-year-versus-last-year, 2018-versus-2030 one, with no reference to the 7% year on year referred to in the programme for Government. Was that considered?  I have an open question about the reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane. The discussion on that is welcome and important. What does it mean in real terms? Are the tools to be developed? Is there a commitment on the part of the Government to develop those tools to make assessments separately? What formulas will be used? There is, I presume, deliberate reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane. What does that mean in practical terms? What can the Minister of State say to concerned people looking on today?

I asked what the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane mean. Will tools be developed to account for that? In practical terms, what does that mean and what will it mean?

We want to rule out the option of coming back with an unrevised budget. It would be a significant issue if the Houses of the Oireachtas were to reject a budget and that should mean something in what the budget contains. Those two amendments which form part of this group of our amendments seek to address those issues.

It is really important that the Minister of State hears the concerns being outlined here. This legislation does two big things. It sets ambitious interim targets and 2050 targets and sets out a framework for making a plan to achieve those targets. For me, the framework is about whose voices are heard, who has a place at the table and the level of transparency and accountability. The Minister of State's input will not provide assurance to people who are looking on and are concerned about their input into this process through their public representatives and outside of that. That in itself will raise further concerns in respect of those people who for whatever motivation want to undermine the climate effort. The Minister of State should look at the piece relating to just transition. We had that argument yesterday and may have it again but this piece relating to democratic accountability is important because we are talking about a situation that is unlikely to arise in the first instance no more than in the case of the annual budget in October because we have parties and the Whip system. This is all the more reason to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas a say in this rather than just the Government. I made the point in terms of coming back with unrevised proposals or, as Deputy Naughten said, proposals that are completely revised to the extent that they look nothing like the first revision in any way. It is an issue that needs to be heard and addressed here between now and Report Stage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-09 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Committee Stage (Resumed)	11	I wish to return to the suggestion that it is an either-or situation. I echo the point that we have to follow the science. There are already huge provisions in the Bill that acknowledge the range of perspectives and voices that have to be heard. This is built into it. What is very important is the process by which we come to agree the budgets and various elements of the plan, whose voices are heard and how we make these decisions. What we are speaking about here is how we agree the budgets, the strategies and the role of the Oireachtas with regard to it. After this, it is entirely appropriate that there is leave to use the courts to ensure these roads are being followed and the plans are being implemented. I do not accept that we should write the Oireachtas out of this piece in terms of its role for oversight, scrutiny and approval. The Government's approach is completely unnecessary because there will be very limited circumstances and the situation might never arise. I do not believe it should be there in the first place.

(n) The factors specified in clauses (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VII) and (IX) of paragraph (m)(ii) have the same meanings they have in section 2 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.”  This amendment is quite self-explanatory. I am sure the Minister of State has had sight of it. From our perspective, it is trying to fill out, and make more complete and comprehensive, the process for appointments. The framing and wording are adapted from that used for appointments to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. We believe it would be an enhancement on the process that already applies.   I also raise a query with the Minister of State. I am conscious that concerns have been raised by the CCAC about some aspects of the Bill. The Department briefed the CCAC. The CCAC has looked for legal advice in recent days. It would be helpful for us to know what that advice related to. Was it related to the appointments process or the tools for measuring emissions? I would like to hear from the Minister of State about that.

What does that legal advice relate to? We know from the CCAC minutes on 15 April that it was agreed legal advice would be sought to provide clarity on some aspects of the amendment Bill and to assist the council in approaching its work. At pre-legislative scrutiny stage, we heard from witnesses about the role, and prospective role, of the CCAC. It would be helpful for us to know what its concerns were so we can factor them into our considerations at this stage. Do the CCAC's concerns relate to the appointments process, for which we have this amendment?

It would be helpful to us, as legislators, if in this session or later ones, or before Report Stage, we had an opportunity to consider the CCAC's concerns in order that they might be either ruled in or out or, at the very least, considered in the context of the legislation we are discussing.

We discussed this earlier. I am not entirely clear on the criteria by which amendments have been excluded. I know that the committee will follow up in that regard and I have done the same myself. This amendment seeks a financial, social, economic and rural impact assessment. We have looked for one elsewhere and those types of amendments have been ruled out for a range of reasons. This is an important opportunity to carry out such assessments to consider the potential impact of this for a range of reasons. We have had this discussion already. We seek adequate involvement and engagement from communities such that there is transparency surrounding decision-making. Nobody for a second is suggesting that anyone will be afforded the opportunity to avoid responsibility, but it is fair to say there are those who would point to what they see as contradictions within decisions that have been made about our response to climate change, whether in one sector or another. I mention as an example the importation of peat from the Balkans or Germany at a time when restrictions are in place here. We must be sure there is an adequate economic, social, financial and rural impact assessment of these decisions.

(f) Notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 11, in fulfilling obligations under those paragraphs, any recommendation to the effect of a reduction in a food production activity must be made on the basis of sustainability as it pertains to individual aspects of that food production activity and with due regard to the social, economic and rural impact of such a reduction. (g) Notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 11, any recommendation pertaining to livestock numbers must be accompanied by a sustainability, social, economic, and rural impact assessment outlining the effects of such a recommendation on a local and regional basis.”,”. I will let Deputy Carthy, who is joining us now, speak to amendment No. 194.

There is a consistency through the Sinn Féin amendments. There is a very clear theme not just in our own amendments, but in the various amendments that have been submitted by the full range of opposition parties and groups, in fairness to everybody who went to the bother of scrutinising the Bill and looking at where they felt there was room for improvement in relation to it. Key to those themes are the level of accountability, the democratic nature of the way decisions are made, who has a voice at the table and whose voice is heard and not heard. The amendments also seek to ensure and to make explicit in the Bill the values that will be upheld as we embark upon this journey towards net zero, including fairness in respect of burden sharing and equality.  I have argued - this amendment also speaks to the point - that there is an ethical, moral and environmental rationale for making such things explicit. I also believe there is a political rationale, because it speaks to the very real concerns communities right across the country have, based on experience to date and many of the arguments that have been made in the past number of days and will be made in the next few hours in relation to the prospect of what we are setting ourselves up for here and the real risk that by the nature of the potential for emission reductions in certain sectors compared to others, there will be unfair burden sharing.  I echo Deputy Carthy's point. I put it to the Minister of State that given everything he has heard on this amendment and throughout the meeting today, along with the Minister, when he was present, it is clear this Bill is not the finished article. It needs to come back improved on Report Stage.

Thank you Chair for your stewardship. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their engagement. The level of engagement and the large number of amendments submitted by the Opposition is a reflection of how serious we all take this issue. That was true of the committee on pre-legislative scrutiny stage also. I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the number of days of engagement and the debate and discussion we have had. All of us can count to nine or ten on a given day and we know the numbers in terms of the Government and the Opposition, but the amendments coming from the Opposition are being tabled for a reason, which is that there is room for improvement and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that before the Report Stage debate on the Bill on which we will also fully engage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-02-20 12:00:00+00:00	Nomination of Taoiseach	1	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus guím comhghairdeas air freisin as a bheith tofa. Táim an-sásta an deis seo a ghlacadh tacú le hainmniúchán an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald mar Thaoiseach. Is mór an onóir agus an phribhléid dom é sin a dhéanamh.  I am very happy to support the nomination of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to the position of Taoiseach because I believe it reflects entirely the mandate given to this Dáil and my party, Sinn Féin. In particular, I believe it is the mandate given to the Deputy by the people of Ireland on 8 February who want her to be Taoiseach.  Many commentators said the general election result was seismic and I agree. There can be no doubt about it. The election was uplifting, positive and liberating. This was an election full of hope for a better and brighter future and it prescribed a clear mandate and message for us today. People are hungry for change and, throughout the election campaign, they said enough was enough. They said that as a country and people, we deserve better and we demand better. I think everyone in this Chamber can agree on that. They said we deserve better in health and housing - the national scandals. However, they also said they wanted a break from sitting in congested traffic; from public services that do not exist, work or make sense; and from working from morning to night not seeing their kids during the week but not having the few spare euro needed to treat them at the weekend. This is the life, or the existence, created for them by previous Governments and they want change. On 8 February, the people spoke. Hundreds of thousands of them came out and voted for change like never before. More than 530,000 people voted for Sinn Féin alone. As a result, as we enter the early months of a new decade, people are now more hopeful than ever that change is possible. They are more hopeful that politics and politicians will deliver that change. They do not expect miracles but they will not accept excuses. They know enough about the world and have seen it done well elsewhere so they know their demands are entirely reasonable and realisable.   This Dáil has an unprecedented mandate for change. More than any other party, Sinn Féin is the party that received that mandate for change. More than any other leader, Deputy McDonald is the leader who received that mandate for change. Deputy McDonald would be in every way a fitting Taoiseach. She has shown that in spades. This is a unique opportunity in the history of our country. I urge Teachtaí to support Deputy McDonald for Taoiseach to lead a Government for change and to implement a programme for change that is fitting for the clear wishes of the Irish people. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-04-16 14:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Health): Statements	1	I wish to ask about the Be On Call For Ireland initiative. This is a great initiative. It has really tapped into the national mood and the number of respondents was fantastic. It has been reported as 72,000. It has also been reported today that out of 14,000 candidates deemed satisfactory, that is, 14,000 qualified and registered nurses, doctors, staff who can work in medical laboratories, ambulance staff and healthcare assistants who are immediately available to work, just 1,300 are being made available for a role or have started a role. Speaking on my own behalf, I was one of the 72,000 who signed up on 17 March. As a qualified medical scientist I am one of the 14,000 but I am not one of the 1,300. Instead of waiting for a third holding email from the Be On Call For Ireland initiative in one month, I made my own arrangements through the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine. I am on standby to return to the laboratory bench in the case of a surge. Like so many others I am of course happy to do that, though I hope we do not see that surge.  That experience raises a question. We are in a crisis situation. Why is more not being done to maximise the potential of this initiative? What are we doing to ensure that applications will be processed more quickly? These staff are seriously needed on the front line in our nursing homes, our residential care facilities and elsewhere.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-06 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Tourism): Statements	1	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute. I am sharing time with Teachta Cullinane and Teachta Daly - five minutes each.  When we heard on the news over the weekend that tourism was among the sectors worst hit by the Covid-19 job losses, it came as confirmation for most of us rather than a surprise. The sector is crucial. In many areas it is the beating heart of local economies but, dependent as it is on the movement of people, it has been decimated by Covid-19. The tourism and hospitality sector supports an estimated 260,000 jobs in Ireland. That is 11% of total employment, making it our largest local employer, and it has reached into every region and county. Some 70% of jobs in the sector are outside Dublin - 6,500 of them are in my county of Meath - highlighting the regional contribution of tourism and its vital role in spreading employment opportunities and prosperity across the entire country.  In recent weeks we have seen pubs and restaurants, shops, hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast premises, museums, galleries, theatres, visitor centres, tour operators - the list goes on - closed, many with hundreds of employees who have thousands of years of combined working experience. For many, it is a lifetime's work. I extend my solidarity to those workers at this uncertain time.  If the economic impact is great, I suggest that the social impact is many times that. Festivals, events and places that bring people together are all out of bounds. These are matters of the greatest importance. Literally hundreds of thousands of workers and their families - entire communities in some cases - are waiting in anticipation.  I have two questions for the Minister of State. We need a dedicated recovery plan for the tourism and hospitality sector. The business supports announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the weekend do not go anywhere near far enough. They are not ambitious enough, focused enough or extensive enough. Will the Minister of State commit to the establishment of a tourism recovery task force to develop and deliver a dedicated tourism recovery package? In his opening statement, he made reference to looking at the structures. Will a tourism recovery task force be part of that? Will he outline a timeline for the delivery of that?  Separately, our air and sea ports are the vital lifelines for the tourism and hospitality sector and we want to see them thrive but there are concerns that essential Covid-19 precautions are not being implemented. It is suggested that entrants are not being screened and followed up, and social media magnifies that. Will the Minister of State outline the plans in place to ensure that ports and airports will not act as Covid-19 vectors and will be ready to respond to the increased traffic that we hope to see in the coming weeks and months?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-13 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Cronin and Wynne. We will respectively take seven minutes, four minutes and four minutes. If the Minister does not mind, I will ask some questions and request a response, and we might go back and forth.  My first question concerns the Covid-19 checks and the controls at our ports and airports, particularly the latter. We know that our airports have never been quieter. Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were down by 57% in March, and possibly by as much as 90% in all Irish airports last month. Despite these low passenger numbers, the current system of Covid-19 checks and controls, including the public health passenger locator form, has proven entirely inadequate. It is reported that approximately one third of passengers do not fill out the form and a further one third do not answer follow-up calls. We know that Ryanair wants to resume 40% of flights from 1 January. This could lead to significantly increased passenger numbers at our airports at a time when the citizens of Ireland are supposed to be staying within 20 km of our homes. We also know that the European Commission is today publishing a strategy paper on resuming leisure travel in a safe and co-ordinated manner. Will the Minister acknowledge that the current system of checks and controls at our ports and airports is not fit for purpose? Will he assure people that public health advice, and not the commercial interests of airlines, the European Commission or anybody else, will determine transport policy at ports and airports at this time? Will he outline the measures that will be introduced to ensure the very highest standards of Covid-19 checks and controls at our ports and airports as we progress through the different phases of relaxation? Are protocols being developed? Are temperature checks being considered? What about additional powers for the Garda? What are the plans for the 14-day period of isolation? Is the Minister working with colleagues in the North to ensure that these protocols apply to all ports and airports on the island of Ireland?

I want to raise the issue of traffic guarantees and how they might be affected at this time during the Covid-19 crisis. Has the Minister any information about the liability that the taxpayer is now coming under as a result of traffic guarantees on public private partnership projects, given the fact that traffic volumes have nose dived? What are taxpayers' liabilities for March and April, for example? Have the Minister or his Department investigated whether there is a

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-05-20 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Children and Youth Affairs): Statements	1	Covid-19 public health advice is deliberately intended to restrict the movement of people and to get them to stay at home or as close to home as possible. While this public health advice has a significant impact on us all, it has a very profound impact on children at risk. I refer to children who live in homes that are not safe havens or sanctuaries; unfortunately for some children, home is the exact opposite.  People working in this area say that we have a perfect storm. We have children forced back into abusive homes but without the usual, normal protections provided by the mandated people who help to keep them safe and out of harm's way, like teachers, for example, who would otherwise spot something untoward. They also say that offenders are more active online now and are acting with more freedom. On the one hand, opportunities to abuse are greatly increased while, on the other hand, opportunities to intervene and help are reduced. I am sure we are all concerned about this matter and I ask the Minister to provide an update to the House on it. What has been the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on children at risk and on our ability to identify, protect and support them? One indicator might be referrals to Tusla, for example. Have these increased during this period, as one might expect in the circumstances, due to increases in cases of abuse or have they decreased, as one might fear, due to reduced reporting? I ask the Minister to provide an assessment and to outline her plans to respond and intervene. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	1	I will take seven minutes and Deputies Quinlivan and Wynne will take four minutes each. I welcome the announcement of the establishment of a task force for aviation recovery. It is very much needed and I ask that it be established and get through its work as quickly as possible. I recommend and encourage the Minister to include the unions representing workers, including Fórsa, SIPTU and IALPA, in the stakeholder forum. It is important that they are represented.  I acknowledge that in the Minister's opening statement he stated he is concerned that the industry has no certainty about when business might grow again. This is a significant destabilising influence in and of itself. I point out to the Minister that the aviation industry, citizens and customers of the industry look to him, as the Minister, and the Government for direction on this.  At the Covid-19 committee yesterday the Secretary General of the Department of Health said NPHET advised the Government on 3 April that the passenger locator form and 14-day period of self-isolation should be mandatory. The Government ignored that advice. More than three weeks later, on 26 April, the passenger locator form was introduced but it was voluntary and not very well adhered to, as we know. Only on 28 May, a further five weeks later, was the form made mandatory.  On what basis did the Government ignore the NPHET advice on 3 April only to be half implemented on 28 May, a full eight weeks later?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	2	It was stated at the committee yesterday that the advice from NPHET was not adhered to or was not taken on board at that time anyway.  We were also told yesterday the Minister for Health is currently examining the possibility of a mandatory 14-day period of self-isolation. This is causing considerable confusion. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport referred to the industry as well as travellers, including would-be holiday makers, looking to the summer and beyond. For how long will the 14-day self-isolation period be in place? If someone has a family holiday booked in mid-July, will they be expected to self-isolate for 14 days? Can the Minister give us a month, a week, or a date when this restriction will be lifted?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	3	Is the Minister indicating that we will move to a stage when the 14-day period of self-isolation will be mandatory? Is that something the Government is planning to implement?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-03 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport, Tourism and Sport): Statements	4	Okay. I thank the Minister.  One of the public criticisms of the 14-day period of self-isolation is that somebody can come out of the airport and hop onto a bus to their final destination with the possible transmission of infection. It is exacerbated by the lack of face coverings on public transport. Anybody using public transport will be aware of that. Yesterday at the Covid-19 committee meeting, I asked Anne Graham of the NTA if she would insist on face coverings becoming mandatory for all passengers and drivers on public transport. She said it was not her decision, but it was a decision for the Minister and for Government. I ask the Minister the same question. Will he insist and when will he insist on face coverings being mandatory on public transport for drivers and passengers?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-10 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Wynne and Ó Broin.  I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue. Transport will be central to our moving towards a low-carbon economy. Over the past 30 years, the transport sector showed the greatest overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions at 137%, with road transport increasing by 143%. In 2018, transport was responsible for 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. Those figures give a sense of the challenge. They are also, in large part, an indictment of the failure of successive Governments to address this challenge properly. It is clear that we cannot afford to continue down the path of emissions increasing year on year. We must take people out of cars by providing alternatives that make sense. The Minister's annual transition document highlights this on page 33, which states that the provision of meaningful alternatives to the private car is central to decarbonising the transport sector. This is true, but it does not mirror the actions of this Government. We must invest in public and active transport.  We have a problem with car dependency across the board. It is compounded by uneven regional development. People who live on the east coast, in Dublin and in the commuter belt areas are acutely aware of the increase in road transport. People in my constituency of Meath East most certainly are. This is due to chronic underfunding of public transport, resulting in it being undesirable. It takes too long. One is sitting in traffic at Blanchardstown, The Halfway House or Glasnevin and it costs too much. We need high speed, high volume bus routes running on quality bus corridors.  We must also invest in rail. Despite being ideally located next to the capital, County Meath does not have a rail line serving the vast majority of the county. Navan is the highest populated town in Ireland that is not served by train. Large urban centres such as Ashbourne, Ratoath and Dunshaughlin would benefit greatly from such a service, as would towns such as Kells and Trim. Without it, thousands of commuters are forced to spend hours in traffic getting to and from work. They prefer the car because it is more bearable. Sinn Féin has consistently highlighted the urgent need for a rail line from Dublin to Navan, which would take thousands of cars off the road each day and bring massive benefits to commuters who could spend less time in traffic and more time with family and friends. Will the Minister give an update on the Navan rail line and its potential to contribute to a low-carbon economy? When will the review of this project be completed and when will the project be funded? This must be part of an ambitious and transformative plan for public transport that serves to reorientate the transport system on the island of Ireland.  We must improve electric car infrastructure and supports. We need to have more people out of cars but we also must recognise that for many people a car will remain a necessity. This is particularly true in rural Ireland, but is not unique to it. Electric cars remain prohibitively expensive for most and the necessary infrastructure such as fast charging points is simply not in place. Has the Government any plans to make electric cars a more affordable and realistic option for people?  On the issue of rural transport, large areas of my constituency currently rely on the Local Link transport scheme. It is known as Flexibus in counties Meath, Louth and Fingal. Flexibus provides a great bus service to people in rural areas who live off the main transport routes, young people who have no access to public transport and people with disabilities who need accessible transport. It is a vital service that provides connectivity for large parts of rural Meath and for some of our most vulnerable citizens, the old, the sick, and people with disabilities. Unfortunately, despite increasing demand and huge unmet need, its budget has remained static. It is now faced with a funding shortfall which is putting services in jeopardy. Meath Deputies met the NTA on this issue last Friday. Will the Minister engage with the authority on this to ensure funding is made available to secure the future of this environmentally friendly public transport option?  On the issue of private bus operators and taking people out of their cars, the Minister will be aware of the challenges now facing private bus operators who also provide crucial transport connectivity for citizens, including many school transport services. Many of those bus operators have been left to fend for themselves with the Government gambling on whether they can make it through the current crisis. If these services are not protected, it will leave a significant gap in our transport services, forcing people into cars. This is another example of how Government policy states one aim but actually does the opposite. Will the Minister intervene personally on the issue of private bus operators to ensure we have a healthy bus and coach sector post Covid?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-11 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Sport): Statements	2	We will see how we get on. I have a couple of questions for the Minister and will afford him the opportunity to answer. I commend all the sporting organisations, as I am sure everybody does, on their efforts during the Covid-19 crisis. They really have been the backbone of the community responses. I thank them for their sacrifice. This goes from kids missing out on a kick about to the elite athletes missing out on the Olympics or some of the high points of their careers in some cases. The importance of sport and sporting organisations to the social fabric of Ireland has been put up in lights and its importance spans a wide range of Departments, whether they relate to culture and heritage, health, mental health, regional and rural affairs or children. This is not even including the business element.  Many local sports clubs around the country have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and despite many local people availing of facilities in order to keep fit and exercise, many clubs are now facing financial trouble because they are unable to operate or fundraise locally. For example, clubs may not have been able to run a lottery or hold fundraisers while clubhouses are closed. Will the Government make extra funding available to help sports clubs and, if so, what form will that take?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-11 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Sport): Statements	3	I thank the Minister and Minister of State. I have a question on gyms and swimming pools. Many avid sports people are keen to get back to the gym or swimming pool and their routine of exercise. Under the original roadmap, swimming pools were set to open in phase 4 while gyms were scheduled to reopen in phase 5. Will the Minister provide an update on this plan under the reconfigured roadmap that was announced last week? Is it the case that both these types of facility are set to reopen on 20 July?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-11 12:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Sport): Statements	4	My final comment will be to echo the sentiments expressed publicly and in this Chamber in the past 24 hours in regard to the boxing community. I am a member of a boxing club and I am very proud of the contribution boxing has made in communities across Ireland. I am very proud of our amateur and professional boxers who have done so well on the world stage, in the Olympic Games and in world championships. It is very important that the State make every effort to ensure that professional boxing is not hijacked by elements that we would not like to see involved in it and that Ireland's name continues to shine strongly on the world boxing stage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-17 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	1	"The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says precious little about our heritage, our past or our archaeology. There is literally one line in it which states: ""There will be detrimental impacts to social and cultural assets."" Sin é - that is the sum total.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter. It is very important that we recognise the importance of our built and archaeological heritage, including sites of historic and cultural significance and also recognise that they are threatened by climate change. Most importantly, we must recognise what we might lose if that were to happen, not only in terms of the physical artefacts but also the heritage, identity, stories, memories and meaning those sites carry. It is important work. Sites are at risk of damage as a result of flooding, storms, coastal erosion, soil movement, pests and moles, fires and maladaptation, among other things. We have seen examples of this across the island, such as the partial collapse of Dunbeg Fort in Dingle in 2018, the impact of coastal and inland erosion on the Spanish Armada wrecks off the Sligo coast and the collapse of Rathcannon Castle during Storm Ophelia. There are many more examples which were well identified during the consultation relating to the drawing up of the sectoral adaptation plan. The consultation document is interesting because it gives an insight into the importance people place on their local heritage sites. I commend the work of local heritage groups. I am familiar with the work of many of them in my constituency, including those in Kells and Ashbourne. Ashbourne is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year.  On the other hand, we have also seen some benefits, for want of a better word, from extreme weather events. In Meath in 2018, the very dry weather resulted in the discovery of further archaeological features across the Brú na Bóinne world heritage site. Similarly, ancient skeletons were unearthed by Storm Ophelia. Overall, it is a story of threat and risk and a question of conservation, protection and management.  I have two questions. First, at what stage of progress are the management plans relating to Tara and Sceilg Mhichíl and will they adequately consider the potential impact of climate change? Second, what plans has the Minister to address the challenge of climate change and heritage in the context of tourism demand?"

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-17 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	1	I welcome the opportunity to address this topic. Like a number of previous speakers, I am familiar with the important work of the OPW on flood relief, particularly from my time as a county councillor in Meath. I worked on the CFRAM and FEM FRAM programmes in the east Meath and Fingal area up towards Ashbourne. I commend that work. In my experience, we had works in Ashbourne, which are ongoing, as a result of flooding in 1986 and 2002, before my time, but when I was a councillor, we had very bad floods there in November 2014 and a flood alleviation scheme as a result. Like everything, it did not come quickly enough and there was not enough money and so on, but I commend David Keyes from Meath County Council and the officials from the OPW and the Department who worked with local public representatives and local residents to move that project along. I hope it will meet its completion date.  I have a couple of questions. The first broadly concerns the role of the OPW, not just in flood relief but also its management of a number of very important sites, including heritage sites, which are vulnerable to climate change. I spoke to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, during an earlier session about this matter. What plans does the OPW have regarding heritage sites and the mitigation of the threat of climate change, whether in terms of flooding, extreme weather events or other issues?  The other point I wanted to raise was the important role of the OPW as a notifiable body in planning. We have seen the bad aspects of planning in the recent past with houses built on flood plains. What efforts will be made by the OPW working with local authorities to ensure we do not see those situations again? My fear is that we will continue to see them.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-17 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)	2	The Tara management plan is a work in progress. Another issue has arisen that is quite local. It is relevant especially in terms of the new dispensation that we are all ambitious for in getting people walking and cycling. We have been involved in the Ashbourne linear park project for many years. This is a cross-party project. Meath County Council is ambitious for it. We have had a difficulty in dealing with the OPW because the office wants access to the waterways. Will the Minister contact the OPW and ask officials to sit down with Meath County Council officials and local public representatives to try to iron this out? There is a happy medium whereby we can keep the OPW happy in terms of its access. This is a resource that the community wants. We want to deliver it but a barrier exists.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-07 14:00:00+01:00	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	1	"Page 51 of the programme for Government states that the Government will: ""Ensure the best possible safeguards are in place to protect our friends and family in nursing homes."" Yesterday we heard the harrowing account of the treatment of one nursing home resident in County Meath, Ultan Meehan, and the condition in which he was transferred to Connolly Hospital where he later passed away. In early June, I raised the case with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, HIQA and the HSE. It is very apparent that the monitoring of private nursing homes falls between the cracks and that the system is totally inadequate. A full independent investigation is needed in this case. In the sector more broadly, we need robust safeguarding legislation and legislation to improve clinical governance. I think that is agreed across the board. What are the Taoiseach's plans for this matter? Do they involve expanding the role of HIQA and the HSE?"
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-14 14:00:00+01:00	Maternity Leave Benefit Extension: Motion [Private Members]	1	It takes a village to raise a child. Covid-19 and the restrictions that came with it put that fact up in lights. In the very short time I have, I will focus on first-time parents. I am familiar with the experience myself. People leave the hospital full of enthusiasm and love and bursting with pride but, in truth, they do not know what they are at and are half petrified. To overcome this, they lean on their family, friends, neighbours and anyone else who is willing to help. In normal times, there are many such people.  My good friends, whom the Minister knows, Micheál Óg Ó Gallachóir and Emma Dillon Gallagher, became parents for the first time on 14 March when Emma gave birth to beautiful baby Faolán. The picture of the first time baby Faolán met his grandad, seven days later, was posted on Twitter. It was retweeted 106,000 times and received 714,000 likes. It was seen all over the world. The new parents were asked to do media interviews in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. We could ask why that was the case. Many people will have seen it in the media. It is because in the photo Faolán is not in his grandad's arms - he cannot be - and his granddad is outside the house, peering in through the kitchen window at his grandson in his son's arms. Three generations are separated by a window due to Covid-19 restrictions. There was novelty in the story of the photo, but actually it was very sad. New mums and babies such as Emma and Faolán have been denied some of the very basic and essential supports that would otherwise be available. Routine check-ups, visits from the public health nurse, vaccinations, therapies, mother and baby groups, and breastfeeding circles have similarly been cancelled or postponed.  Postnatal depression has apparently increased threefold during the Covid period and I have no doubt the same applies to anxiety. Childcare is a significant issue and it needs to be addressed. It takes a village to raise a child. Covid-19 has denied mothers and babies that benefit. It has been said to me that we were forced to close the doors and lock ourselves away for three months. The only compassionate and decent thing to do for new mothers and babies is to support the Sinn Féin motion. I support Deputy Carthy's proposal that the Government withdraw its amendment as it does not go anywhere near far enough. I commend the Sinn Féin motion to the House.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-15 09:30:00+01:00	National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	"I am sharing time with Deputies Seán Crowe and Buckley.  The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 to provide for the establishment of the climate action fund on a statutory basis. It also provides for the 2 cent levy that currently funds the National Oil Reserves Agency to be redirected to support the fund. It is proposed that the climate action fund will be used to support projects aimed at reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy production, improving energy efficiency and helping regions and sectors hit by changes that cut carbon emissions. Such a fund, constituted correctly and fairly and spent wisely, could really assist the State in its response to the climate crisis. Therefore, Sinn Féin is happy to support the Bill.  The National Oil Reserves Agency was established as a stand-alone agency under the 2007 Act. Its function is to arrange for the holding of national strategic oil stocks at a level determined annually by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, for supply in an emergency. NORA is currently funded by a levy set at a rate of 2 cent per litre on the sale of most petroleum products at the point of sale. The levy is collected by the oil companies each month and paid to NORA to fund its activities, including operating expenses incurred in the purchase of petroleum products and securing storage in Ireland and abroad.  The NORA levy was increased by the then Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in 2009 from 1 cent to 2 cent by way of SI 214 of 2009. That statutory instrument imposes a 2 cent levy on petrol, green diesel, diesel oil, fuel oils and kerosene, but specifically excludes jet fuel of the kerosene type. Will the Minister of State explain why jet fuel was specifically excluded from the provisions of the 2009 statutory instrument? According to the European Commission, direct emissions from aviation account for some 3% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 2% of global emissions. If global aviation were a country, it would rank in the top ten emitters. In 2020, global annual international aviation emissions are already approximately 70% higher than they were in 2005. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, forecasts that, in the absence of additional measures by 2050, they could grow by a further 300%. Given the huge emissions the aviation industry contributes, should jet fuel be excluded from the levy that will support the climate action fund? Why should ordinary motorists be obliged to pay that levy when large airlines are not? I ask the Minister of State to address this point in his response. The NORA levy was increased in 2009 to reduce the €440 million in debt NORA had accrued. According to NORA's 2018 financial statement, a programme of debt repayment was undertaken between 2012 and 2017. By 31 March 2017, NORA's loans were nil, and this position has been maintained since then. As of the end of August 2019, NORA held a cash balance of €221.7 million. Over the period 2019-23, average levy receipts are expected to be €141 million per annum, while average NORA expenses are expected to be €76 million per annum. Section 44(3) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 states: ""In determining the rates of levy, the Minister shall seek to ensure that (taking one year with another) the sums realised by applying those rates to the volume assessments meet but do not exceed the estimated expenses of the Agency and of each designated subsidiary"". However, this levy has obviously far exceeded the expenses of NORA. Has there been a breach of legislation to date due to NORA collecting an excess amount of money via this levy? The Comptroller and Auditor General was asked this specific question by the Committee of Public Accounts last year and he said it was a legal question. Has the Minister received legal advice on this?  I also raise the issue of the up-to-date cash balance of NORA. The 2019 financial statements are not available online. Will the Minister outline the current financial state of NORA? Section 14 of this Bill includes the provision that any levy moneys collected or recovered prior to the commencement of the Bill ""shall not form part of any payment into the Climate Action Fund under this section"". On what exactly will NORA be spending the large sum of money that has accumulated in its accounts? I ask the Minister to address that at some stage. I have outlined the figure of €221 million from last August, but does the Minister have an updated figure? Considering that NORA accumulated debts of €440 million just a decade ago, is the Minister satisfied that this will not happen again? Will there be transparency and oversight here, given the significant cash balance?   This Bill will convert a levy on fossil fuels, which was introduced for the specific purpose of paying down a debt and funding NORA, into a levy on fossil fuels that will fund climate action initiatives. Taken in combination with the Government’s proposed punitive carbon tax, this will now be a double tax on fossil fuels, on which people rely to heat their homes and run their cars. Has the Minister considered this? We already have 400,000 people living in fuel poverty in this State, and this Administration wants to quadruple the carbon tax over the next decade. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, confirmed that to me earlier today. Does the Minister agree that this will push more people into fuel poverty, as real affordable alternatives are simply not available for most people? Similarly, the Minister previously proposed a fee and dividend approach to carbon tax, but this has since been abandoned by the Green Party. Will the Minister outline how he will assist those already living in fuel poverty and the many more who will be at risk of it due to the severe hikes in carbon tax the Government is proposing? How will those people be helped?  The Bill also amends the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide for NORA as a designated body to which the NTMA may provide central treasury services. This allows the NTMA to take deposits from NORA, make advances to NORA, or both, as an alternative to the current utilisation of commercial banks. Irish Water is also to be given the same designated body status under the NTMA legislation. This facility is intended to facilitate the restructuring of Irish Water's funding arrangements, whereby existing funding from mainly commercial banks can be replaced with more competitively priced State-funded debt facilities. Are there any estimates of how much these changes could save Irish Water and NORA?  The Bill also proposes two substantive changes regarding the use of biofuels in Ireland by providing for technical changes to the biofuels obligation scheme, in addition to setting the rate of the biofuel levy to a nominal amount. Biofuels are intended to assist EU member states in meeting their emissions reduction targets. However, ensuring that biofuels are produced in a sustainable way is central to them reducing greenhouse gas emissions without adversely affecting the environment or social sustainability. Will the Minister provide further details about the Government’s plans in this area?  It has been stated that the climate action fund will provide €500 million in support to projects over the period of the National Development Plan 2018-2027. It was previously announced that the annual expenditure will be approximately €10 million in 2020, €30 million in 2021, €40 million in 2022, €80 million per annum in each of the years from 2023 to 2026 and €100 million in 2027. Has the Minister considered front-loading this investment to stimulate the economy post Covid-19 and to make quicker progress on our emissions targets?  My time is running out and I cannot see whether my colleagues are here to take over."

At the moment, there is contradictory and conflicting advice on travel, which is undermining confidence in the aviation sector and the public health effort. Aeroplanes are taking off but the advice is for people to avoid non-essential foreign travel. It is proposed to extend this advice by way of the publication of a green list on Monday. This policy is incoherent, contradictory and confused and it is having a very significant impact on people who have booked package holidays and flights abroad. Will the Tánaiste indicate what protections he will provide for consumers in those circumstances? Will he call on the airlines to allow people to reschedule for free or to provide vouchers or refunds as appropriate?

I am disappointed also the Minister is not positively disposed to them. I support all the amendments, which strengthen the Bill and expand the scope and the opportunity the Bill presents. It is disappointing the Minister is not taking the amendments on board. I do not accept the strength of his argument against taking them on board. That in and of itself is disappointing. As others have said, there is an opportunity in this Bill to make a very significant impact and significant change. I agree we need to reframe our structures and need a paradigm shift in terms of how we engage with the issue of climate action. We need to bring people with us but we also need to reframe our structures and move away from the idea that it is about technological solutions and essentially generate a climate action industry.  The amendments proposed by Deputies Whitmore and Naughten aim to strengthen the Bill. It is fair to commend Deputy Naughten on his work on this initiative and on this legislation at an earlier stage.  I raised a number of issues on Second Stage as did the Acting Chairman. We did not have the opportunity to come back to them and I would like it if the Minister, when responding to these amendments, addressed some of them. An issue I did not raise last night but I would like to raise now is an amendment which will be tabled in the Seanad tomorrow and which I think has pretty significant implications. My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, will deal with it in the Seanad. Tabling an amendment in the Seanad rather than here is an indication that this Bill is being rushed to a degree. That is not a good way to legislate and more time should be given to consider it and to hear more from various stakeholders.  The Government will table that amendment in the Seanad. The rationale for the amendment-----

That fund should be spent in a fair and transparent way. Some of the amendments being tabled, although not in the Dáil unfortunately, call that into question. Will the Minister provide us with assurances because I need them now in terms of how we will engage with the Bill? Will he provide us with assurances that the funds that will be available from the fund will be properly governed, accounted for and spent in a clear and transparent way? We have heard this repeatedly that it will be competitive tender but the indication from the Seanad amendment is that it will not be. Who is to say that these will not be pet projects of this or any other Minister? That is something people watching want clear assurances on.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-22 09:30:00+01:00	National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2020: From the Seanad	1	The Minister has said the Government amendment is to provide legal certainty on funding for projects where there will not be a competitive tender. Bog rehabilitation was the example the Minister gave in the Seanad last week. I understand and appreciate the rationale, but as my colleague, Senator Boylan, told the Seanad, and as I put it in this House last week, the Minister must put processes in place to ensure this mechanism is not misused by himself or his successors lest they wish to use it for their own pet projects. It is in everyone's best interests that the highest standards of financial governance and oversight would be in place. This money will be provided by the public, so it is important that there is transparency and accountability in the allocation of these funds. We take the Minister's bona fides on this and therefore we are happy to support the amended Bill.  I had asked for an updated figure on the current financial state of NORA. I understand that it could have a few hundred million euro in its accounts. The latest figures to which we had access were from August 2019. Will the Minister provide the Dáil with the latest figure in his closing statement?  I encourage the Minister to engage more with Deputies and Senators on future climate action legislation. This is our first exchange on legislation. There were some very positive amendments, though not my own, put forward in the Dáil and Seanad and it was a shame that they were not incorporated into the Bill. Most were not controversial and would have added value to the legislation.

We are an island nation and the sector is of essential strategic importance but it has been adversely affected by Covid-19. The approach of the industry in response to this has been to delay refunds and the issuing of vouchers to people who had flights cancelled, to charge exorbitant rescheduling fees for people adhering to the public health advice and to cut jobs and change the terms and conditions of workers. This is doing reputational damage to the sector and undermining public health advice and the public health effort.  Does the Tánaiste agree that this approach is unfair, unsustainable and unacceptable to workers and customers? What will the Government do to address this matter and to provide supports for customers and future sector needs?

The commitment to public transport is fundamental to the programme for Government and private operators play a key role in scheduled services, tourism, tours and school transport. It is an important issue. These providers are honest, decent, hard workers and they deserve the full support of the State.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:30:00+01:00	Future of School Education: Motion [Private Members]	1	I have good reason to focus my time on classroom sizes in Meath, as we have the highest in Ireland in Ashbourne, or on school buildings. Lismullen national school, for example, is one of the oldest and in the most urgent need of address. However, I wish to focus my comments on access. The future of education has to be one of public and active transport. That must the way of the future as it makes sense with or without Covid-19. We must get children walking or cycling or on the bus and out of cars. That said, there are areas that urgently need to be addressed. Many schools have no footpath access to the front door. One in five reported this to be the case in a recent Green-Schools survey.  It is clear that we must support and expand our school transport system. I urge the Minister to meet representatives of the school bus transport sector. They were out in droves protesting today. They have been treated very badly during the pandemic. Many were left without any State supports and they are on their knees. The Government's back-to-school roadmap did not contain enough detail for them. The operators I spoke to today still have a range of questions. They want to know what obligations will be placed on them with regard to loading and unloading buses. For example, will it be left to them to police the proposed compulsory seating arrangements? In terms of the funding announced, there is very little detail about how the €11 million will be allocated. Time is precious as we only have four weeks.  It is clear that a comprehensive, long-term strategy for school transport is long overdue. The service has been eroded over the years. I refer to what is happening with concessionary passes, for example. The service has been hollowed out and this must stop. We must address it and a step change is needed now.

We have all received correspondence from airline pilots, particularly in regard to Aer Lingus, our national carrier. There is a real conflict between the interests of the aviation industry and the interest of public health. It is important for the State to step in to support our national carrier. Some aviation workers feel vulnerable regarding the future prospects of the sector and their own jobs. It is a major employer and of considerable strategic importance. Those workers need every support. The future of the aviation industry cannot be built on targeting people who have flights booked but who are not in a position to travel while heeding public health advice. I ask the Taoiseach to step in on behalf of the workers.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-08 14:00:00+01:00	Cancer Screening: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I commend Deputy Cullinane on tabling the motion. It is timely and important. The CervicalCheck scandal and now Covid-19 with the suspension of screening programmes have brought cancer care in Ireland into focus again. I am sure others will address the important issues of delayed and missed diagnoses and the unnecessary pain and hurt this causes. Others will mention the poor outcomes we experience in Ireland. Five year survival rates for ovarian, colon and rectal cancers lag considerably behind other wealthy western countries.  I want to focus my comments on the essential role of medical scientists in cancer care, screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. As it applies to Covid-19 testing, a headline in a national newspaper two days ago read, ""Overworked medical scientists warn of burnout as testing requirements increase."" The same could be said at any stage in recent years of the general services that medical scientists are expected to perform, many of which relate to delivery of cancer care. This is a proud profession that feels underappreciated and undervalued. I know this myself because I worked as a medical scientist for a number of years, starting in 2003. The representative bodies - the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine and the profession's union, the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association - have, in my experience, stated their concerns loudly over two decades. We should be very proud of this profession, and I am sure the Minister is. We produce fantastic graduates, the best in Europe. There is a competition every year and we win it consistently. All those in the profession are educated to degree level, most have master's degrees, many have multiple master's degrees and many have PhDs. Increasingly, they are taking on FRCPath and MRCPath. We do not train enough medical scientists. Of those we train, 25% emigrate or go into industry. Those who stay to work in the Irish public health system are frustrated by the lack of recognition or of career progression opportunities. They have lived with pay inequality for decades, and that needs to be addressed.  The Minister and I have spoken privately about this before. I know he is interested in the opportunity there is available. I believe there is a clear win for the Government in this. I ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to take the opportunity to meet representatives of medical scientists. They have a great opportunity to contribute significantly more than they are being asked to contribute. I think there is a win there for the Government and I would appreciate it if the Minister took up that proposal."

St. Ultan's special school, Navan is served by 22 buses, all of which are close to capacity. Twenty of those buses carry students for St. Ultan's and other schools, including St. Mary's special school. Issues in that regard need to be acknowledged and addressed as quickly as possible. I have been contacted by numerous parents who have expressed their genuine and earnestly-felt concerns. They need to be addressed.  The issues extend beyond that and I encourage the Minister for State to contact her colleagues in education and transport about the constraints on school bus transport. Some 120,000 children were carried on buses last year, including 14,000 with special educational needs. Only 97,000 places have been allocated this year, a reduction of 23,000. That urgently needs to be tackled. My colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, in conjunction with me and Deputy Conway-Walsh, has submitted proposals for tackling that matter. This obviously has clear implications for mainstream and special schools, children with additional needs, and people who are attending day services. It also has implications for the broader transport network. I have been contacted by numerous people who are delighted that services are beginning to open up again albeit that service is patchy and partial. The lack of transport services is a significant block. We must get back to a place where those services are provided again.  I thank the Minister of State for meeting a constituent of mine, Ms Laura Campion, who has been advocating on behalf of her sister. As we have heard from other Deputies, the Minister of State is engaging with groups but we want to see as much progress as possible. Particular concerns have been raised about contingency planning. Nobody wants to go back to lockdown so let us see the plan to continue opening up services and providing respite for families. It is not an issue about day services but it has been reported that some people have experienced significant difficulty in accessing respite, which is of concern.  I will speak about access to day services for adults who live in a residential setting with my remaining few seconds. Service providers have stated that service users in residential respite will be unable to attend their day service under current HSE advice. That is of considerable concern and the gap needs to be addressed.  I wish the Minister of State well in her efforts to tackle those problems.

I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Broin, Ó Snodaigh, Paul Donnelly, Ó Laoghaire and Mitchell.  Yesterday, thousands of taxi drivers took to the streets in protest. Nose to tail, they filled four lanes around Merrion Square and every inch between there and Ballyfermot. It was an incredible display of solidarity and strength but it was also a last resort for them. I take the opportunity to commend the four taxi representative groups which organised the protest, namely, the Taxi Alliance of Ireland, the National Private Hire and Taxi Association, the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation and Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann.  Yesterday's protest was an event of unprecedented scale and was borne out of the absolute frustration of taxi drivers at an unprecedented time. The four representative groups make five demands of Government. First, they want a financial package to help taxi drivers get back to work which recognises that the current one-size-fits-all approach by Government is wholly inadequate for those sectors worst affected by Covid. This is particularly the case for drivers who work for themselves. Second, they call for the retention of and continued access to bus lanes and quality bus corridors for taxi drivers. Third, they are seeking a moratorium on the issuing of taxi licences and the introduction of a buy-back scheme. Fourth is a request for a two-year extension to the nine-year rule. Their fifth demand is for the disbandment of the taxi advisory committee and the establishment of a national transport forum.  These five demands reflect the three core issues which are at the heart of the taxi drivers' protest and at the heart of the Sinn Féin motion, namely, the need for recognition, respect and support for a sector which provides an essential public service and has been devastated in a very particular way by Covid and the restrictions that come with it. Taxi drivers provide an essential service within our transport network. Many people with disabilities rely on taxis daily, whether for school transport, trips to and from scheduled services or simply to get them from A to B. The same applies to the transport of essential healthcare staff and goods. Taxi drivers work 365 days a year, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. That is a statement of fact. They should be recognised by Government, and feel recognised by Government, for the essential role they play in our transport services.  The Government should ask itself why they feel no such recognition. Taxi drivers are regulated and licensed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and display the Transport for Ireland sticker on their vehicles. Why do they not feel recognised or respected? The answer is that they can point to where they have been excluded, isolated and ignored. Their call for the disbandment of the taxi advisory committee is an example of that, as is the handling of the phantom proposal in regard to bus lanes. I am glad the Taoiseach clarified that particular issue yesterday in the Dáil when he said it was not on the agenda. He and the Minister will be held to account in that regard. It is an example of how taxi drivers have been excluded from decisions about their own industry and their own future. That is completely unacceptable. They are at the end of their tether. Work has completely dried up. The industry is entirely dependent on the movement of people, a busy Croke Park, a busy airport, busy nightlife, gigs and festivals, and busy businesses. All of these are gone. Coupled with the wholly inadequate supports provided by the State, thousands of drivers are struggling to make ends meet. To put it bluntly, they cannot make ends meet. Fixed costs have remained in place. The NTA estimates that these are in the region of €15,000 per year. Many taxi drivers have been left with little or no income for six months. If they are lucky, they are on a reduced Covid payment and eligible for a €1,000 grant in support. One should bear in mind, however, that they might be expected to pay €40,000 for a new vehicle on 1 January 2021. They are watching more people enter the sector as licences are being given out, thereby diluting the available work.  I look forward to this important debate. It needs to mark a step change in Government engagement and support for the sector. I urge Members to support the motion, which reflects the drivers' concerns and calls on the Government to step up and recognise the important role taxi drivers play in our transport system."

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-16 10:00:00+01:00	Taxi Industry: Motion [Private Members]	3	"I thank contributors to the debate, which was useful and important. The protest yesterday, along with a number of opportunities during debates in the House yesterday where the issue of taxi drivers was raised, and this debate have brought a focus on the sector. I again commend the four representative groups that organised yesterday's protest and the thousands of taxi drivers who attended. It provided the opportunity for discussion. I thank those speakers who have given voice to the sector, to individual drivers and to how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected it in a very particular way.  I acknowledge the contributions that reflected the impact this is having on mental health and on drivers' sense of themselves and of their contribution to society, the economy and communities more generally. Very valid points were raised and it was very important that we had the debate, but it does not end here. It is important to acknowledge the Government's recognition that taxi drivers are an essential part of the public transport system, the clarification on the matter of high-quality bus corridors and bus lanes, and the acknowledgement that there is a problem with the funding streams available for sectors that have been especially adversely affected by Covid-19, as well as the specific issues relating to taxi drivers.  I turn to the Government's countermotion, which is completely unsatisfactory. It outlines what has happened to date. There would not have been thousands of protestors on the streets yesterday if what had happened to date had been satisfactory or sufficient, and that needs to be recognised and acknowledged. On specific issues such as the nine-year rule, it was a ""No"" from the Minister of State, with the matter to remain under review.  On the issue of the taxi advisory committee, it is completely unsatisfactory to say the vacancies will be filled. That does not acknowledge that the taxi advisory committee does not have the confidence of ordinary taxi drivers. It is to miss the whole point of the argument. Taxi drivers are knocking on the door and saying, ""Please listen to what we have to say and please acknowledge our concerns."" The Government, however, is saying a committee will do that and that it will fill the couple of vacant places. It should ask itself why there are vacant places on the committee. It is because it does not have the confidence of ordinary taxi drivers.  On the issue of a licence moratorium, there was a ""No"" from the Government. That needs to be addressed and acknowledged as a potential solution and a reality for the sector. It is not good enough to say nobody is really applying for licences anyway. The Government needs to get ahead of that.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his role at the Department of Finance, but the primary issue is financial and relates to sector-specific supports. It is reflective of others, such as the arts and events industries, which other Deputies mentioned. The taxi industry is a case in point, and these sectors need full support from the Government.  This will be an ongoing issue. It will not go away until it is addressed. As a number of speakers noted, taxi drivers are ready to go again. Sinn Féin will keep the matter on the agenda."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-17 10:30:00+01:00	Climate Action: Statements	1	I welcome the Minister back to the House. I shared a similar experience to his in recent weeks. It is part of living with Covid. It gives us a clear understanding of the importance of a testing and tracing system that is responsive and rapid. Personal behaviour and a sound healthcare system are the foundation on which our future will be built.  I welcome the inclusion of statements on climate action in the schedule. It is important we keep the topic at the top of the Dáil's agenda although statements on their own will not be enough, and the Minister is aware of this. We need tangible changes that will alter our current path. I look forward to the Minister bringing forward the climate action Bill soon and working with the Government to ensure it is ambitious and fair. The Minister might provide us with an update on its progress.  The challenge of climate change is undeniable despite what some might say. The science is clear and the evidence is powerful and alarming, whether it be in California at present, Siberia in recent months, the Arctic Circle or Australia. I have a brother in Australia with whom I speak weekly. When he speaks about bad weather it is not like the bad weather here. What he means is that it is so warm people cannot go outside or the forest fires are so close that the children cannot go to playschool. We have had our own experience in Ireland in a clearer way in more recent times. Through Met Éireann's detailed and reliable climate data, which has been collected since the mid-1800s, we can see Ireland's average annual temperature has increased by 1°C over the past 100 years. I commend the work of Met Éireann and the work of geographers throughout the country, including at the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit. The Minister's colleague at the Department of Education and Skills is still intent on downgrading geography as a subject at junior certificate level and this is a regressive move for the climate effort.  Our climate has changed and is continuing to do so. We are now seeing more damaging storms and more destructive floods as a result. The evidence is clear to everyone. We have seen examples of this across the island such as the partial collapse of Dunbeg Fort in Dingle in 2018, the impact of coastal and inland erosion on the Spanish Armada wrecks off the Sligo coast and the collapse of Rathcannon Castle during Storm Ophelia. There are many other examples such as the extreme and concerning coastal erosion at Portrane, County Dublin.  It will not be enough to continue simply building flood barriers and hope for the best. Man-made protections are no match for the power of climate change events. Without significant change, this will be the new reality for billions of people across the globe for years to come. It will take a global effort to alter this trajectory. I believe Ireland can become a world leader in eliminating reliance on fossil fuels and changing our habits to greener alternatives. If it makes sense for people to do it and if it is done in a fair and equitable way, then there should be no issue.  For this to happen, however, the Government's approach must be one of bringing people along on the journey with it. Taxing people who have no alternatives or carbon shaming people simply will not work. The Government's proposed increase in carbon tax is exactly the wrong approach. This October the Government will increase the cost for people to heat their homes and drive to work with far more significant impact on income inequality and deprivation indices than on carbon emissions. Most people would love an insulated home and solar panels on their roof. Many would love an electric car or the option of no car at all. This is a million miles away, however, from most people's current household budgets. In fact, it is beyond the capabilities of the infrastructure and public services which the State provides, particularly public transport services, due to government underinvestment for years. Taxing people more this October and for the next ten budgets will not change this. In fact, it will make the issue worse.  Affordable alternatives need to be in place before a behavioural tax can work. In the meantime, it is not a behavioural tax but a punitive one. Not only does it hammer those who can least afford it, it leaves a sour taste in people's mouths about climate action. They feel they are being punished for something totally out of their control. It is the exact opposite to bringing people along on the journey that we are supposed to be on together.  There is the targeting of items such as two-for-one dinners included in the recently launched waste action plan. The action plan commits to working with retailers to end the sale of multibuy packs. There was a significant and understandable angry public response to this for two reasons. First, many people depend on these special offers to feed their families. When one looks at the cost of rent, insurance and childcare and other living costs, this is a reality for many families. Second, people thought of the many other actions that could be taken to target the environmental sphere. Two-for-one dinners are not the highest priority. There was a particular media presentation but it was dreadful.  The same applies for penalising people for buying more affordable clothes. It is insulting and offensive to people who are struggling to make ends meet. It reeks of that idea of going for quality over quantity and telling people to stop being poor. It reminds me of Terry Pratchett's boot tax where those wealthy enough can afford good boots which last longer and they save money in the long run while those who are poor go through many more boots at more expense.  We have to understand the position which people find themselves and the way they engage with the environment, the climate and the economy. We have to meet them where they are. These proposals infuriated people not because they do not want to tackle waste in the fashion industry but because it is yet another tax on the consumer rather than tackling the root causes behind it. Solutions to our waste and environmental challenges cannot just always be a levy or a tax on consumers. This has always been the go-to and simple idea by successive Governments. It does more harm than good to people's attitudes to green politics.  On energy policy, I have spoken privately to the Minister on the North-South interconnector. My honest and heartfelt opinion is that it will not proceed as currently proposed. Planning permission, North and South, is not available due to the level of public opposition. Will the Government engage with communities to find a way forward? There is a way forward but it will only be found with genuine engagement. I would like to know the Minister's plans in this regard.  Transitioning from a reliance on fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy will play a key role in our national climate action effort. Recent industry reports have indicated there are significant challenges in that regard which the Minister acknowledged. What measures will the Government take to address them?  The level of community engagement in the RESS, renewable electricity support scheme, is a real positive. Is enough being done, however, to maximise the potential to look at new economies and new models of delivering energy? I do not believe there is. I am happy to work with the Minister as Opposition spokesperson to advance the opportunities for community-generated energy, as well as for communities to be able to plug in and contribute to the grid.  I live in County Meath where we want people to use public transport. For that to happen, public transport needs to work for people. We need an improved bus network and the Navan rail line to be opened. We have discussed this on numerous occasions and we will continue to do so. I hope it can be progressed. Sinn Féin has committed to playing a constructive role in opposition. We understand and accept the need for system change and to work towards a zero-emissions economy. We are clear in our position, however, that it must be done with, not to, communities. Fundamental to that is the principle of climate justice and a just transition.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-22 13:30:00+01:00	Community Safety and Fireworks: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy Ward for bringing this motion forward. It is timely and important, particularly for the people living in the areas most affected. It is fair to say that these issues present in different ways in different places, some at the more extreme end. The solution is the same in all cases and it is clearly outlined in the Sinn Féin motion. It is about ensuring there are sufficient Garda numbers for prevention and deterrence and adequate community resources, both physical and human.  I am a Deputy for Meath East, as is the Minister. Our county has the lowest number of gardaí per head of population in the State. One of our new towns, Ratoath, is the largest town in Ireland without a Garda station. We have the youngest small towns in the State in Stamullen, Enfield and Longwood and the youngest large towns in Navan and Ashbourne, according to census data. These towns have it in common that they have grown rapidly in the past two decades and have been victims of the Celtic tiger. It has been all about houses and more houses. County Meath has the lowest number of playgrounds, public green spaces, community centres and youth facilities. In the case of the latter, if one does not play GAA or soccer, they are non-existent. There are residents in one particular area in Ashbourne who have spent years trying to protect the last remaining patch of green space for their children to play. They have presented their case to Meath County Council and An Bord Pleanála time and again only to have the rug pulled from under them in the past week. In trying to provide a decent environment for their families to live, they are doing the State's work. Instead of being supported, they are being impeded at every hand's turn.  In ten years' time, when the same issues are being debated again in this House, the Deputies representing County Meath will, if they are honest, be saying that things have got worse. We will all know why that is the case. I am contacted on a regular basis by residents in Kells, Stamullen, Ashbourne and Ratoath, among other places, about nuisance and antisocial behaviour. The Minister knows well that such activity is regular and to an extent that warrants address. Some people are being terrorised in their own homes. We see the evidence of it on every community Facebook page and it must be stopped. I urge the Minister and all other Deputies to support the Sinn Féin motion. The Minister must increase the Garda presence for prevention and deterrence and increase community infrastructure, both physical and human. That is what is needed.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 (Transport): Statements	1	I am sharing with Deputies Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Maurice Quinlivan; they may or may not arrive. I will have an opportunity during Question Time tomorrow to raise the taxi industry, public and school bus transport and other important issues relating to transport with the Ministers. I will be glad to have the opportunity to do that. I want to focus today on the aviation industry. I echo the Minister's commendation of front-line transport workers during the Covid period. Although the aviation sector was one of the worst affected sectors, few specific proposals have been introduced to mitigate the damage caused by the pandemic in this area. The report, Focus on Aerospace & Aviation, prepared by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and published last month, highlights the value of the aviation sector to the State and outlines the huge challenges now posed as a result of Covid-19. Some 140,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector here, but many are now in jeopardy due to the ongoing pandemic. The staff range from airport staff and cabin crew to mechanics and aircraft leasing employees. The industry is worth €8.9 billion to our economy. As an island nation, we depend on quality air connectivity more than most for business and tourism.  Page 8 of the report states:  Unaided, many airlines could go out of business before travel restrictions are lifted. Some governments have already provided loans or taken temporary equity stakes in airlines and airports to moderate disruption, for example in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the US. On this point, what plans, if any, are afoot here to provide State support to airlines in the form in question? I am aware of the supports the Minister outlined in more general terms. The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme remain in place.  Workers at Aer Lingus fear for the future of their jobs, given the crisis facing the aviation sector, which will stretch right into 2021 and beyond. If the treatment of these staff, in terms of the refusal to sign benefit entitlement forms, is anything to go by, these fears are well justified. That issue is not resolved. There is some movement on the employment wage subsidy scheme but the temporary wage subsidy scheme and back pay still need to be addressed. Could the Minister, in his closing comments, state whether he has made contact with the company or his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys? When will this issue be resolved? When will staff get their back pay?  On the company more generally, has the Government discussed a proposal on cash for equity in Aer Lingus to shore it up, protect jobs and guard against the loss of important routes? Similar moves are happening internationally and are being permitted under the relaxed EU state aid rules that have obtained during the pandemic. Earlier this year, the German state took a 20% stake in Lufthansa in exchange for a €9 billion rescue package. At the beginning of this month, the European Commission approved a €200 million bailout for Alitalia, with the Italian Government now retaking control of the airline. It is important that the Irish State try to protect as many jobs and routes as possible to ensure connectivity for the travel, business and inward tourism that we will depend on for our recovery.  It was a terrible decision to sell the State's remaining shares in Aer Lingus in 2015, and one Sinn Féin opposed. Fine Gael and the Labour Party ignored the very legitimate concerns raised at the time, and we are now living with the cost. A sum of €335 million was raised from the sale. The proceeds were used to set up a fund called the connectivity fund, managed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. According to information I have recently received from the Minister for Finance, only €90 million of this has been invested to date, leaving a pot of €245 million unspent. Has the Minister examined using the money sitting idle in the connectivity fund to shore up jobs in the aviation sector, including through retaking a stake in Aer Lingus and providing financial assistance to our regional airports, such as Cork and Shannon, which are facing massive challenges?  Our regional airports are facing their biggest challenge due to Covid, with only a couple of flights in and out each day. Management at Cork Airport has said the Covid-19 crisis has had a catastrophic impact on the airport's finances, with passenger numbers having fallen by 95% during lockdown and not expected to recover to 2019 levels for another four years. The airport said it will lose around €20 million this year as a result of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus and Ryanair have threatened to close operations at Shannon Airport, which would be a serious blow for the entire mid-west and fly in the face of the objective of balanced regional development.  Is the Minister planning to provide financial assistance in the upcoming budget to airports affected by the pandemic? I am not for a second suggesting we automatically dance to the tune of the multimillionaires who run Ryanair and Aer Lingus but we have to recognise that when we come out the other side of this, we will need an aviation sector that is intact and strong.  Airlines will cite the Government's approach to international travel as one of the factors contributing to some of their current difficulties. Six months into the pandemic, it is shameful that we still have no testing capabilities in our airports, nor even the most basic temperature screening of arriving passengers. People fill in a form and they are literally on their way. One will not find a less restrictive process anywhere else in the world these days. We now have seven countries on the green list. As of an hour ago, with Germany having been added to the list, six of the seven countries have restrictions on Irish people travelling thereto. Most of them have some sort of testing regime. If other countries around the world have introduced testing and temperature screening at their airports, why has the Irish Government decided to take a different approach? At the Covid committee this morning, we heard about the opportunity that exists regarding testing. I will not elaborate on that but will let my colleagues contribute.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-24 10:30:00+01:00	EU-UK Negotiations on Brexit: Statements	1	I would like to raise the issue of connectivity. Yesterday, I raised the aviation sector with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. There are very particular challenges there, as the Minister will be well aware. This morning, we heard from Mr. Eugene Drennan, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, and Mr. John Martin, the policy manager for haulage association in the North. They share the same concerns, albeit from geographically different perspectives. They stated that trade will be severely upset because of Brexit and the price of some goods could double. They stated the impact will be significant and that they have been warning about it for two years. Systems that were promised and planned are not in place either here or in Britain. On the British side, customs agents have not been recruited and the goods vehicle management system, GVMS, and Smart Freight IT system are not in place. There is a threat - it is to be hoped that is all it is - that there could be queues of up to 7,000 vehicles at ports in Britain. Our own systems are not up and running. There is no contingency planning. There are approximately 800,000 to 1 million movements of units annually between Ireland and Britain alone. It is a massive challenge.  I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister about the strategic importance of connectivity for us as an island nation. This morning, the two spokespersons to whom I referred addressed the issues of surety of service, timelines, just-in-time delivery and the whole logistics operation on which so much of our economy and livelihoods depend. They spoke of the need for an alternative route bypassing Britain and going straight to the Continent. What I wish to emphasise is that we have only a few months to prepare and, as the saying goes, failing to prepare is preparing to fail. The window of opportunity is very limited. Every effort must be made to put the required systems in place. I refer to the three-step system that has been promised on this side because the obvious consequences on 1 January and thereafter are spectacular and need to be avoided at all costs.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-13 13:00:00+01:00	Financial Resolution No. 2: Excise - Mineral Oil Tax: Motion	1	This carbon tax is brutal, punitive and a lazy cop-out. It is a failure by the Government to take the hard decisions and to tackle the root causes, the big polluters and the issues of poverty, including energy poverty. It is also a failure to provide alternatives. There is the equivalent of a two and a half-year wait for the warmer homes scheme. Were one to join the queue today, 8,000 people would already be on the list. With approximately 3,000 houses being processed per year, that represents a wait of two and a half years. Even if someone wanted to do his or her part, he or she would not be a position to do so thanks to the Government.  These increases look like they will be nailed on, but the so-called offsets like fuel allowance are not nailed on in any shape or form. It is a damning indictment of the Government.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-15 10:30:00+01:00	Financial Resolution No. 7 - General: Motion (Resumed)	1	I welcome some of the positive announcements in the budget in the areas of climate action and transport. Investing in our public transport system, active travel options and improving the quality of our roads and rail lines are all vitally important in addressing our emissions obligations and improving the quality of life of our citizens. Unsurprisingly, I also want to address a number of the areas where we believe the Government has failed and set out why we believe these issues should be approached differently.  Sinn Féin's position on a carbon tax is well known. It is not that we do not want to address the use of fossil fuels in our homes and cars, but we believe targeting people with a punitive tax is not a fair or just approach and it will not actually help. In fact, it will do the opposite. The carbon tax applies to all the things people cannot do without, such as petrol to get them to work, gas to cook their dinner and home heating oil to keep them warm.  The 29% increase announced is inherently unfair as the richer a person is, the easier this tax is to avoid. Those who have the money can buy electric cars, install a fleet of solar panels on their roofs and retrofit their homes, thereby avoiding the tax increase in all of these areas. Most people simply cannot do this. Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said the carbon tax will help people to choose the right thing. The Labour Party said the carbon tax is the litmus test of our commitment to our climate obligations. That reflects the starting position for individuals. I was genuinely astonished by those statements.  Many people would love to choose an electric car and have their homes retrofitted so their heating bills would not be sky high. They would love to choose to have solar panels on their roofs or take a train or a dependable bus instead of sitting for hours in traffic. Most people do not have a spare €50,000 to buy a larger vehicle or retrofit their home and get a heat pump. By pushing up their bills through a carbon tax, they will have less money tomorrow to do all these things. The Government is punishing people for not being able to afford the cost of upgrading to greener alternatives. That is a punitive and brutal approach that will hamper our transition to a low carbon society and will really hurt people in the process. The people who are being targeted are the most vulnerable and will bear the most significant burden.  The carbon tax increase is already going to impact some of the industries already on the floor due to Covid-19. Taxi drivers and bus operators are going to be hit with significant additional fuel costs all while their businesses have been decimated. Again, these industries want to transition to cleaner and greener alternatives but affordable, realistic alternatives are simply not there yet. Punishing them with higher bills now will make their precarious financial situation worse and will not actually help the environment. As my time is limited I will conclude on that point.  I look forward to the Government and the Ministers publishing more details on their budget proposals, particularly in the area of retrofitting which was light on detail. We know that there are very significant delays and waiting lists and the figures in the budget need significantly more scrutiny which I look forward to giving.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-21 10:00:00+01:00	Post Office Network: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank the Regional Group for tabling this important motion. Sinn Féin is happy to support it. We have submitted an amendment which we believe further adds to the motion and we hope that people can support it. The work of postmasters and workers throughout our postal service has been vital during this pandemic, ensuring that people can stay in contact, access their weekly payments and pay their bills. I commend An Post's recent initiative of providing free post to our friends and family who are resident in nursing homes. It is a fantastic idea and commendable, and I hope people make good use of it.  Sinn Féin has always been vocal in its support for protecting the post office network. Post offices are crucial services in our towns and villages and are especially important in rural Ireland where they provide essential services and serve as a meeting point in local communities. Despite the invaluable role that our post offices play, the network has regrettably suffered from years of neglect by successive Governments, with hundreds of closures and the loss of vital outlets throughout rural Ireland. These include post offices in my constituency of Meath East which were closed in 2018, including my local post office in Tara, and at Bellewstown and Clonalvy. I remember them as a county councillor at the time and there are other examples. Post office closures have had a severe impact on individual villages and communities. Local shops subsequently closed.  At that time, Sinn Féin tabled a motion on the future of our post office network. Some 159 post offices were earmarked for closure, including seven in Meath. There was little more than rhetoric from the then Government. Nothing was done to secure the future of the network. We asked that the proposals contained in the 2016 Kerr report, which included post offices providing alternative services such as financial services and Government services, be implemented immediately. We also suggested that a new model of community banking be established through the post office network to fill the void left by commercial banks in rural Ireland. Two years later, we are in much the same place, with even more challenges facing our post office network and little interest from Government in dealing with it.  Last month, the Irish Postmasters Union commissioned a report which sets out the significant challenges faced by post offices across the State and highlights the significant value and contribution they make to our economy and society. One of the central recommendations in this report is that a public service obligation be introduced to secure the future of the network and allow post offices to continue to provide their excellent and important services. Some €17 million per annum was suggested for this annual public service obligation. When Sinn Féin tabled its motion on the future of post offices in September 2018, Fianna Fáil tabled an amendment calling for just such a public service obligation to be introduced. With Fianna Fáil now the lead party in government, will it follow through on this commitment, which can secure the post office network, or is this just another broken promise? I note there is no such commitment in the Government's amendment this morning. We have included it in our amendment and, on that basis, we ask Fianna Fáil and its colleagues in government to withdraw its amendment and support the Regional Group's motion and the Sinn Féin amendment.  Another proposal that we have included seeks the expansion of the role of post offices as a one-stop shop for those inquiring about and applying for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland grants or other similar green initiatives. These will be crucial in future. There is a welcome and much-needed commitment from Government to expand these services, which we appreciate, but many may not be able to access these grants through online portals. Our post offices should become a place where people can access information about these grants, talk to a person about them, be encouraged and persuaded if needs be, and get help in applying for them. This can help to increase the uptake of these grants and also provide our post offices with a new avenue of business. We are having a conversation at the Joint Committee on Climate Action about public involvement in addressing climate change and our obligations. I believe that post offices can play a key role in outreach and engagement. It is a win-win for our post offices and environment, and I ask the Minister to consider further expansion of this emerging role for post offices.  We need creativity from the Government. We cannot have business as usual. We cannot come back next year with another debate on the same challenges. Post offices are critical State infrastructure throughout our island and need proper investment, ambition and attention from this Government.

I thank her for that. She outlined the nature of the time pressure due to legislative changes at EU level so Sinn Féin is happy to support the legislation. I will keep my comments brief given the requirement to deal with all Stages this week to ensure the legislation can be put in place by 31 October.  Railways are an incredibly important part of our transport infrastructure serving workers, tourists and businesses across the State. The neglect of our railways by successive Governments in the 20th century set us back decades and it is a price many people continue to pay today. Some 81% of people who leave my county of Meath daily to go to work do so by car because the rail infrastructure was allowed to crumble and disappear in the past 60 or 70 years. It is a terrible shame which is replicated in many other areas, most evidently in the north west where there is a total absence of rail connection.  I spoke to the Minister of State previously about the need to invest in our railways to make up for lost time and contribute to our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. There is a compelling case to be made for passenger and freight rail.  The work of the RAIU is to investigate when things go wrong on the rail network. The purpose of an investigation carried out by the RAIU is to improve railway safety by establishing the cause of an accident with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future. In 2019, the RAIU completed 43 preliminary examination reports into a wide range of incidents on our railways. These included tram road traffic collisions, a trap and drag incident on the Luas, level crossing collisions, derailments, fires, cattle strikes, apparent self-harm occurrences and a near miss collision between a train and a rail worker. It is clear from those few examples that the work of the RAIU is very important and is central to establishing what has gone wrong in a particular situation to try to prevent its recurrence in the future.  It is vital that these powers of investigation are available for rail accidents including those on light rail and heritage railways. This Bill seeks to ensure that continues to be the case after 31 October taking account of changes at EU level and therefore we are happy to support the Bill and facilitate its expedient passage. The RAIU is a small operation that comprises very few individuals but the work they do is extremely important and often goes under the radar. We want to thank them for that work.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-21 10:00:00+01:00	Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	1	"I am conscious that the Chamber and the Houses of the Oireachtas have approached this legislation and this type of question numerous times in the past. Those most vulnerable and in need of support have often fared poorly.  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters was never meant to be an end in and of itself. Maybe there are those who hoped it would be. Maybe there are those who wished it never happened. There is no doubt that the commission in its terms of reference was far from complete or comprehensive. For example, in my county of Meath, the Good Shepherd Sisters Ard Mhuire home in Dunboyne was included in the work of the commission but the St. Joseph's and St. Clare's institution in Stamullen was not, despite the fact that we know it was a mother and baby home in every practical meaning of that term. Unmarried mothers were separated from their babies there. Babies died there. Some babies underwent vaccine trials there. Advocates estimate there were over 180 such institutions. Many survivors were excluded from the process.  In the conduct of its business the commission has refused survivors the opportunity to a public hearing. Then it made the case that there was little demand for such public hearings. In this way and in other ways the commission was not what it could be and not what it should have been. Despite that, it has done important work. It has compiled, collated, generated and gathered information. The sum total of its work will be made up of each component part and that is what it will leave. A report of 4,000 pages, or however many pages, based on the commission's distinct perspective and analysis, will not suffice and could never suffice.  In the first instance, the archive and records must be available to survivors. This is their wish and it must be respected. The records must stay intact and must not be sealed. They must not go to Tusla. The Minister has the power to make that happen. He can amend the 2004 legislation if needed, although I am unsure whether that is needed. He can retrospectively prescribe if needed - he is already doing that. The Minister should take this opportunity to put right these wrongs and show survivors that Ireland has changed. We stand ready to support him if that is what he wants to do.  Several of my colleagues have used this opportunity to read the words of survivors into the record of the Dáil. With my last few seconds I will do the same. One survivor who spoke to the Clann project on the subject of coercion and forced adoptions said: ""In early February 1968, when my baby boy was six-seven weeks old, he was wrenched from my breast by one of the nuns whilst I was breastfeeding him and taken away for adoption."" She made clear that ""at no time did I give my consent to my son's adoption."" Another said she was not given any other options. A survivor I spoke to said she did nothing wrong and her baby did nothing wrong. They did nothing wrong but they were failed and now is the time to change that."

It is wrong to state that this is related to Covid and that there is no demand. There has never been more demand for school bus transport and never have more children been refused.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-10-23 10:30:00+01:00	 Level 5 Response to Covid-19: Statements (Resumed)	1	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Donnelly. County Meath is in the eye of the Covid-19 storm, with a 14-day incidence number of 1,287, which is 660 cases per 100,000. The people of my county have endured and suffered a great deal, none more so than Mary Bartley Meehan, whose husband, Ultan Meehan, and son, Adrian Bartley, both died during the pandemic. I call on the Government to engage with and support Mary in her quest for information and truth. The people of Meath are anxious but ready to play their part to get the numbers down. The vast majority of people in the country are doing their best but the Government and its agencies have been failing in their responsibility to protect them.  I have been getting a lot of telephone calls about delays in testing and - an issue that is just as significant - delays in notifications of positive test results. We all heard what Dr. Cillian de Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory had to say in this regard earlier today. I have also been inundated by calls regarding delays in tracing. The tracing process was already hugely delayed and then it stopped altogether. There have been Covid outbreaks in schools in Meath and the experience of school management has been that they cannot access advice, support and information. That is not good enough. Instead of creating capacity and increasing resources to deal with the crisis, the Government's answer has been to divert resources. This week, the school immunisation programme was suspended in County Meath. It is simply not good enough. The Government is robbing Peter to pay Paul instead of investing urgently to provide the resources that are needed.  People working in a range of sectors are looking to the Government for help. Business owners and workers throughout the country are crying out for support. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be in the House later. He must, in the first instance, address the situation of mart owners and the issues they have raised. Deputy Cowen outlined those concerns earlier. Travel agents need access to the Covid restrictions support scheme and not just at level 5, as do private bus operators. I have been contacted by a number of essential workers whose work has dried up but who say they are being denied access to the pandemic unemployment payment because they are essential workers. I have heard that from driving instructors, taxi drivers and others. There must be progress to allow self-employed workers to stay on the PUP and earn up to €480 per week. The Government must deliver on its clear commitments in all these areas.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-05 10:30:00+00:00	Finance Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed)	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. I want to raise two issues, the first of which is the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Under the CRSS announced in the budget a business that is impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions, including closure, can make a claim to Revenue for a payment for each week it is affected by those restrictions. That is a welcome support given the massive impact Covid-19 is having on certain businesses across the State. While most businesses have been impacted in some way this year, certain businesses have been severely affected from day one back in March. It has not been a case of one size fits all.  Travel agents have been one of the worst impacted sectors. Given the collapse of international travel due to the pandemic, their entire business model has fallen off a cliff. Despite that, however, travel agents have had to stay open throughout the pandemic to process refunds and vouchers for customers even though they have had no income coming in. When the CRSS was first announced, travel agents were not included. That was a major blow to the sector. They are permitted now to apply for the scheme under level 5 but this is set to be removed when level 5 restrictions are downgraded. The fact of the matter is that there is no level 1, 2, 3 or 4 for travel agents. There is only level 5. The financial hardship and the impact of Covid-19 will not stop for them on 1 December. It is incredible and unacceptable that the Government will remove the support from this severely impacted sector. These are often small family businesses. I know personally of cases where the families have remortgaged the family home to stay afloat. We will need these businesses in the future when the Covid pandemic comes to an end. I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in that regard. It is a very serious matter.  Another sector that is excluded from the CRSS is the bus, coach and chauffeur service sector. In a reply to a parliamentary question recently, the Minister stated that where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as coach or bus operators whose business is ordinarily operated from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria. That is an incredibly unfair position to take. Many bus and coach operators who usually ferry tourists to every corner of Ireland have had no business at all this year due to Covid. There are no gigs, festivals, events or tourism. These companies often carry wealthy tourists to remote corners of Ireland and encourage spending in small craft shops and little cafés in rural villages, which supports thousands of jobs. When tourism starts to recover next year we will depend on those companies to ferry tourists around the country again. Bus, coach and chauffeur services have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. I ask the Minister to reconsider immediately his decision to exclude them from the scheme.  School bus transport is an issue I have raised consistently with various Ministers but it is still a matter that is unresolved. I welcome the additional funding for the sector but figures I have received from the Department of Education show that 97,644 tickets have been issued for school transport this year. That is far short of the 130,144 applications. There is a shortfall of 32,500 seats in the school transport system, meaning one in four children has not got a place on a school bus this year. That is worse than in any other year. There should not be an annual struggle for places. It is not fair on families or students. School transport is vital and needs to be properly resourced. This year's shortfall has caused serious disruption for parents and working families who rely on school buses to bring their kids to and from school. Parents are left cramming their children into people carriers and following the bus to school, often with the children's siblings in the bus. It makes absolutely no sense. I ask that the various Departments and the Minister act on this immediately.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-11 10:00:00+00:00	Regional Airports: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy McNamara and the Independent Group for bringing forward this important motion. Sinn Féin is very happy to support the motion and has submitted an amendment to include the south east.  The aviation recovery task force report, published earlier this year, highlighted the huge value of aviation to the Irish economy. Air transport contributes an estimated €8.9 billion to our GDP and supports in the region of 140,000 jobs across the State.  I, like many of my colleagues, have been in contact with a huge number of constituents who work across this sector and who have been particularly affected by the pandemic and resulting restrictions. These workers range from pilots and cabin crew to airport workers, ground crew, travel agents and other workers who depend on the aviation industry. To a man and woman they have faced real difficulty this year, with little to no work and a huge drop in incomes, putting real pressure on their personal finances. They understand the impact the pandemic has had on international travel but their demand of the Government is fair and reasonable. They want the Government to do all it can to protect their jobs and prepare for the resumption of foreign travel when it is safe to do so.  I have consistently expressed my concern that the  We have heard from the airports' representatives at the transport committee that it takes years of work to secure routes and once they are lost, they are very difficult to get back. Our international airports are crucially important for attracting investment and tourism to the regions and are key to balanced regional development. We cannot allow important routes to Britain and the US especially to lapse during this pandemic.  I very much welcome the additional funding announced by the Minister yesterday for airports around the State, but this was only one aspect of the recommendations of the aviation recovery task force report and much more work is needed. Recommendation No. 3 of the task force report was for a comprehensive test, track and trace system and despite repeated calls we still do not have this. On track and trace, according to figures I have received, 82% of people who complete the passenger locator form do not get a follow-up call. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the requirement for arrivals to restrict movements for 14 days is not being followed in many cases and empirical evidence from the summer confirms this.  On testing, I have been asking both this and the previous Government to put a testing system in place since before the summer. I am glad the Government eventually conceded to this fundamental principle but it took far too long and the system is still not in place. The delay is inexplicable, as is the delay in conducting our own comparative analysis of Covid assay and testing technologies, such as looking at polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing versus loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, testing versus rapid antigen. That should have been done months ago. While we all hope a vaccine will be the key to defeating the virus, that is still just a hope and with the best will in the world it will take considerable time to be administered so a robust testing and tracing system will be needed well into 2021. If it is done right, it can help restart the aviation sector and help tens of thousands of people across the industry get back to work in a safe way. We should rigorously and proactively pursue the option of pre-departure testing with rapid testing technology.  I welcome this motion on the aviation sector and its essential strategic importance but I reiterate that the future of the aviation sector cannot be built on the back of exploiting loyal workers. Newspaper headlines stated that workers were struggling to afford to feed their children. They were hovering above the poverty line due to the way the TWSS and EWSS were implemented. I know that to be the case and it is shameful. Similarly, thousands of customers are still waiting for refunds and vouchers. Many more lost out altogether as ghost planes left without them but with their money. Travel agents were affected in the same way. This is absolutely disgraceful from airline companies and it has not gone unnoticed. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-11 10:00:00+00:00	Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	I have raised this issue with the Minister before. My contribution will focus on how Brexit will affect our road haulage sector and the impact it will have on those using the land bridge through Britain to transport goods onto and off this island. The Copenhagen Economics report commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation found that two thirds of Irish goods exporters or 150,000 heavy goods vehicles make use of the UK land bridge to access continental markets each year. It is a vital route but one that is under threat as a result of Brexit.  Whether it is a hard, soft or indifferent Brexit, new checks and procedures as a result of Britain leaving the European Union will mean significant delays and queues at the Dover-Calais crossing and there is the promise of significant delays at Holyhead and on the Irish side too. These delays will impact on the sector hugely and the Government must move decisively to mitigate this impending crisis for as many hauliers as possible. A report from the Irish Maritime Development Office published in the past few days states that there are currently sufficient shipping connections and capacity to accommodate hauliers who want to bypass Britain and sail directly to continental Europe in order to avoid the delays that will inevitably arise there in January. This, I have to say, came as a shock to many in the road haulage sector who were not consulted in the context of the report and who would dispute the Irish Maritime Development Office’s findings. It is a statement of fact that there is a clear deficit in current roll-on, roll-off services to Europe and gaps in the current shipping schedule to the Continent. We do not, for example, have daily sailings departing for the Continent every day. Exports, such as perishables for example, depend on just-in-time logistics and such gaps in departure times cannot be afforded.  Sinn Féin believes that the Government should prepare contingency plans for State-supported shipping routes, including public service obligation routes. These should be focused on roll-on, roll-off services where vehicles that currently use the land bridge have the option of using new, frequent and direct routes to the Continent that reduce the time at sea to the bare minimum. Leaving it solely up to private companies to put these essential shipping connections in place is an incredibly risky strategy, particularly given the critical importance of these routes for food imports and exports. When I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, she stated that it was up to individual haulage companies to contact ferry companies, essentially in order to stoke up demand. I have engaged with hauliers, very many of whom are from my constituency and my family has worked in haulage for many years. I have engaged with ferry companies as well. I welcome the fact that there is going to be a focus on this matter at the transport committee in the coming weeks but there is not enough focus on it yet from Government. We need to see that because time is of the essence.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-19 10:30:00+00:00	Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. I welcome also the establishment of the Department and the focus on third level and higher education. The third level experience presents people with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and gain additional skills, and it is transformative in its nature. A central theme needs to be around access and ensuring that all people, particularly people from disadvantaged backgrounds, have access. I am thinking in particular of access programmes and postgraduate entry. Several students have contacted me in recent weeks to outline the particular difficulties they are experiencing at this time in regard to postgraduate medicine and other courses which require a less conventional route through third level.  I note the Minister's efforts to support the institutions in the very important work they do and the contribution they make. I am a third level student myself on the Structured Population and Health-services Research Education, or SPHeRE, PhD programme. Given his former capacity as Minister for Health, the Minister will know that NPHET and other groups such as HIQA are currently relying heavily on graduates from that programme in regard to population health epidemiology. It is very important that we appreciate the value of those contributions.  In terms of the effort to undertake basic research, I sometimes find academia can spend a lot of time having to justify its own existence and I want to make the point about the principle of basic research and its importance. I also want to make the point about the opportunity for the new Department in regard to the role of the State in innovation. There is sometimes an idea that it is for big pharma or for the private sector to take on and do this creative work. Mariana Mazzucato and others have written about the entrepreneurial state, which is something we should be ambitious for because we need to take risks in our research. I commend that approach and implore the Minister to take it up.   I want to raise the issue of this year’s first-year students. I mentioned how going to third level education can broaden horizons. Many people come from a local parish or town and are subjected to new influences and meet people from a wide range of backgrounds, which can be very liberating, if messy at times for some people. However, with Covid-19, that has been completely restricted. I received a letter from a parent who happens to be a primary school teacher married to a primary school principal, and who encourages the Minister to contact third level institutions and ask them to look at every opportunity to get young adults on campus. Parents say they are living in their bedrooms with a laptop. That is the experience they are having in first year, which is very different from the first year experience of their predecessors. It is very tough on them and is affecting their mental health and their development. I ask the Minister to consider the opportunities there are to get kids on campus more often.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-11-24 14:00:00+00:00	Covid-19: Statements	1	People are anxious to hear the advice the Government will give for those living abroad who are thinking of travelling home for Christmas. The approach for travel into and out of Ireland must be guided by the public health advice. The emphasis should be on adhering to the public health advice, advising against all non-essential travel, continuing the excellent work of keeping Covid-19 numbers down and avoiding the risk of importing cases but we also know that people have sacrificed a great deal this year. For some people, for example those who have suffered a bereavement, are struggling with their mental health or isolation, coming home for Christmas is an essential journey. While many will choose to stay abroad this year, we need to exercise compassion and common sense and the State needs to prepare for those who do travel. Central to that preparation is clarity and advice and ensuring that people who intend to travel know what is expected of them in terms of the traffic light system, restrictions of movement etc.  Equally important is the system of checks and controls we have at ports and airports to minimise the risk of importing the virus. The system we have in place is not fit for purpose and there are no plans to improve it before Christmas. On contact tracing, the passenger locator form and follow-up is entirely inadequate. On testing, PCR testing is available at airports, which is something, but it is expensive. That is a problem. Also, it is entirely voluntary, which is an even greater problem. I am very concerned that many people will opt out of the airport testing system, which is allowed. In fact, the Minister's Government is expecting it. In the Dáil on 12 November, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, said they are expecting demand for testing to be in the region of 150 to 300 tests per day. When people, myself included, were confused about that figure in terms of whether it was expected demand or expected supply, the Department of Transport clarified that it was the expected demand. Based on October's figures, 150 to 300 tests a day would equate to less than 3% of travelling passengers. It might not be 3% but it is a long way off 100%. If too many people opt out of testing and we have no follow-up on passenger locator forms we are leaving ourselves exposed. The system must be improved and there are options such as mandatory testing, rapid antigen testing and investment in the passenger locator form follow-up. I encourage the Minister to improve on those areas.

I commend my colleagues, Teachtaí Mairéad Farrell and Doherty, on bringing forward this very important legislation. My party was forced to propose these amendments to the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 following recent behaviour by Fine Gael politicians, in particular, which has brought to the fore the flaws in the current system. We have witnessed the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Brian Hayes, walk out the door of that Department and in the door of a banking lobby group. We then saw another former Minister of State at the same Department, Michael D'Arcy, resign from the Seanad to take up a job with the Irish Association of Investment Managers. There are other examples.  This cosy club of politicians and lobbyists is something with which most people are, rightly, uncomfortable. It is a revolving door that Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have sought to keep open over the years. The golfgate event during the summer highlighted the problem once again. Ireland is a small place. Here was a former Minister of State, now a banking lobbyist, mingling with Ministers, Senators, a Commissioner and a Supreme Court judge at a private knees-up. It stank of the rotten politics of the past and reminded people of the problems that still exist and which must be challenged and changed. There is a clear need for a defined separation mechanism to ensure that former Ministers cannot trade on their previous insider knowledge to their own benefit or that of a lobbying organisation and at a cost to the public.  This Bill will implement 13 recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission to the Government in 2019. It will increase the cooling-off period for which Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and high-ranking civil servants must wait before moving from office to the lobbying sector. It will allow SIPO to investigate and sanction breaches of that requirement. It will also give SIPO the power to investigate and sanction persons or bodies that avoid their obligations under the Act, such as by destroying records, emails or text messages. One must question why anyone would object to these provisions. SIPO has called for legislative changes since 2016 to increase its investigative and sanctioning powers, broaden the scope of the Act and tighten up certain definitions. We need immediate action to close the revolving door between politics and vested interests. The politics of the golden circle, the politics of the nod and the wink and the politics of who one knows rather than what one knows must end now. This Bill will go some way towards achieving that.

I will also refer to Ireland's role on the European stage, and Europe's role on the global stage, in ensuring that, as a point of principle, nobody is denied free access to a vaccine based on location, financial means or any other discriminatory criterion. There have unfortunately been 1.4 million deaths as a result of Covid. There has been positive news on the development of vaccines by Pfizer, BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Janssen Pharmaceutica, also known as Johnson & Johnson, in addition to the Russian vaccine. It is worth noting that these vaccines have been developed through very different development processes. Public moneys have been at the very heart of the development of some. Some of this money has come through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, from which Moderna has received funding.  It is fair to say, however, that there have been significant levels of vaccine nationalism. Ireland is in quite a privileged position, as is Europe, but this is a global pandemic and we have a moral and ethical responsibility to lead from the front on that issue. In addition, from a very practical point of view, this is a global pandemic and we want to eradicate the virus globally. Therefore, in addition to our moral and ethical responsibility, it makes absolute sense to ensure that the vaccines are available to everyone who needs them. There are welcome developments at a European level including the COVAX facility and the new citizens' initiative, ""Right to Cure"". These are all motivated by the same intentions. In Ireland there are groups, including Access to Medicines Ireland, that have been campaigning on these issues for years. The global pandemic of Covid-19 has brought these issues into stark relief.   Yesterday, I attended the Oireachtas briefing on vaccine preparations by Professor Kingston Mills. The Government has a responsibility to do everything it can to ensure that supply lines and schemes are in place in Ireland.  I will make two points on the indemnity scheme. There is work to be done in that regard but those who take the vaccine are as entitled to the State's protection as the vaccine producers. It is very important work. The work that Professor Brian MacCraith and his group are doing needs to be supported in every way."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-03 09:00:00+00:00	Finance Bill 2020: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	1	The carbon tax is all stick. It is turning people against the environmental agenda, environmentalism and the effort to address climate change. It has no appreciation of the challenges in people's lives. Approximately 400,000 people in this State live in fuel and energy poverty. There are commitments in the budget and the Finance Bill concerning mitigation measures. They are only partial mitigation, however, and do not go anywhere near addressing the impact of the carbon tax in its totality, not this year and certainly not for the years to come.  The promised retrofitting schemes, the commitment to which I welcome, will not address the shortcomings or offset the impact of the carbon tax this year or into the future. There are waiting lists in the region of two and a half years. It should not be forgotten that some of these programmes are specifically targeted towards our most vulnerable, such as people living in poverty or with additional healthcare needs. The services and supports that are supposed to be in place - I accept Covid has had an impact - are not there for them or are not being delivered on time. Essentially, this is an additional tax with nothing to offset it in any real or meaningful way. The retrofitting schemes have to be bolstered. There needs to be a significant commitment in terms of the recruitment of people. There are workers ready and willing to do that retrofitting work. That needs to happen as quickly as possible.  On 1 December, the protections people had against utility disconnections were stopped. Last year, more than 5,000 people had their electricity disconnected and in excess of 2,400 people had their gas supply disconnected. There is no commitment or protection from the Government for those people today. However, we will introduce a carbon tax, essentially an additional levy for people who cannot afford to pay at this point in time. The public service obligation has been increased by 130%. Again, this is an additional burden on people whom the Minister intends to levy with a carbon tax as well. It simply makes no sense to people and they cannot afford it.  For those living in fuel and energy poverty, there was an emergency credit increase from €10 to €100. However, there was a levy on that. Instead of paying back the €100 recipients were grateful to get, they were forced to pay up to €170. People are penalised for living in poverty. That is the truth. That is what we get off Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and now the Green Party in government. The carbon tax is an insult to injury for those people, a point which the Government just does not realise.  On the just transition fund, those living at the coalface are the workers in Bord na Móna in the midlands and the energy sector. They have been moved out of that employment. They are living with promises from the Government about alternative pathways which have not materialised, again adding insult to injury.  The previous Government committed to a strategy to combat energy poverty but that has not materialised. It committed to an independently chaired energy poverty advisory group but this has not materialised. We are told by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that it will be reviewed next year. It is simply not good enough. It does not connect with the day-to-day experience of people and it is completely unacceptable from the Government.  With regard to the points made by previous speakers, it is one thing where there are alternatives for people but significant sectors of the population, particularly in rural areas, do not have alternatives available to them. This carbon tax is all stick. It adds insult to injury and in my firm opinion it does nothing to serve the environmental green agenda. In fact, it runs completely contrary to it. There is a firm commitment to introduce this for a number of years but there is no firm commitment on mitigation measures nor appreciation or understanding of the challenges people have, at a time when we are essentially forcing people back into their cars because Covid-19 means public transport is at 50% or 25%, depending on the level of Covid restrictions.  Along with the previous speaker, I support entirely the amendments tabled by Sinn Féin and others. I firmly believe the Government needs to realise the practical implications of the carbon tax as it is presented for ordinary people living their day-to-day lives when there are no alternatives for them. The Government has no intention or interest in providing those alternatives. This raises a serious question about what the carbon tax is about.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-09 10:00:00+00:00	Social Welfare Bill 2020: Second Stage	1	I thank my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, for tabling five important amendments to this Bill. Sinn Féin's amendments will help carers, those at risk of fuel poverty, jobseekers and workers, such as musicians and I hope the Government supports them.  I will raise a number of issues with the Minister. Workers in the aviation sector have faced a particularly significant challenge this year, with many on substantially reduced wages or having been let go altogether. I and other Sinn Féin representatives have repeatedly raised the case of Aer Lingus workers, who were being obstructed by their employer and the Minister's Department from accessing social welfare entitlements. This issue was eventually resolved for the EWSS but it has not been resolved for the TWSS. We are told by the Department that workers will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis but the truth is, on a case-by-case basis, these workers are crying foul. They are seeing a cut-and-paste response from the Department. For days in April, May and June when they were explicitly told by their employer they were on reduced days, their UP80 form is coming back all Os and no Xs. Unpaid leave is turning into something else. I call on the Minister in the strongest terms to intervene personally in this matter.  I turn to the matter of fuel and energy poverty. I welcome the increase of €3.50 per week in the fuel allowance. However, this is the Government giving with one hand and taking far more back with the other. The 14% increase in the fuel allowance is totally eclipsed by the 30% increase announced in the carbon tax and the 130% hike in the electricity public service obligation, PSO, levy. The punitive carbon tax will increase the price of a bag of coal or tank of oil for people as they try to heat their homes over winter. The enormous increase in the PSO levy will leave households with higher bills over the next 12 months.  Under section 25 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 2019, the Minister was required to commission an impact assessment on the current and projected future increases in carbon tax on low-income families. It found from various researches conducted that carbon tax increases will impact disproportionately on low-income households. That needs to be addressed and I encourage the Minister to do it in this Bill.

The ESRI reported earlier on this year in terms of lifetime community rating. Like so many aspects of this regime, perverse incentives persist. What happened on the back of the introduction of lifetime community rating was that younger people responded as intended by entering the market, and the insurance industry responded in kind and developed cheaper plans that give less cover. The practical effect of it was that younger people were paying less and getting less for their money, which resulted in significant out-of-pocket payments and a lack of solidarity. The intention of solidarity that was there did not materialise. Out-of-pocket payments remained very significant. On top of that, the indications are that premiums will increase next year by up to 7% and we still wait for the implementation of the de Buitléir report. The solution in all of this is a move away from public investment in private healthcare. There is significant public investment in private healthcare. We need to move to a single-tier public health service on the back of the Sláintecare report. Sinn Féin wants to see an all-island health service that is free at the point of delivery and delivered based on need rather than ability to pay. That is where we need to go.

Significant decisions are being made today concerning rural, one-off planning. Our colleagues on the county council have concerns regarding the nature of the deliberations during Covid-19. The national development plan is also being reviewed and in terms of the hierarchy of documents, significant decisions are being made on rural, one-off planning which will devastate rural communities. The Tánaiste and his Government should seek to suspend the ongoing review of the County Meath development plan until the national development plan has been reviewed because the implications of the current proposals for rural communities would simply be devastating.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-16 09:15:00+00:00	Proposal re Agreement with Danish State on Statistical Transfer of Energy from Renewable Sources: Motion	1	The EU renewable energy directive of 2009 set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demands from renewable sources by 2020. Due to decades of inaction in this area, we are set to miss this target. The SEAI predicts that between 12.5% and 13.2% of our energy requirements will be met from renewable sources this year. There are many reasons for this failure but the actions of the previous Fine Gael-led Administration deserve particular criticism. We have proof positive today that its climate rhetoric was not matched by climate action, although we did not have to wait until today to find that out. Sinn Féin and other progressive voices have been beating that drum for some time.  This transaction is not just bad news for our environment and international climate obligations, it is also bad news for Irish taxpayers who are set to foot a bill of €50 million. To be clear, we have failed to meet reasonable and fair energy transition obligations. A reduction of in and around 1% year on year since we agreed to these targets was required but we could not even manage that. Statistical transfers for target compliance purposes is a convoluted way of saying we are here to agree to pay €50 million in fines for missing our renewable energy targets for 2020. To meet our binding obligations on paper, we now have to buy credits from Denmark and Estonia to make up for the State’s failings in this area. My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, put it well when she said that this is like modern-day indulgences. For €50 million, we get a piece of paper and absolution.   When we look at this from the perspective of opportunity cost, we might reasonably consider what could have been done with €50 million. How many homes could have been retrofitted? How many solar panels or heat pumps could we have installed? How many sustainable energy communities could we have supported? Those opportunities have now shifted to Denmark and Estonia.   It should also be noted that we are paying a higher premium to Estonia, at €15 per megawatt hour, than to Denmark, at €12.50 per megawatt hour. Estonia is getting a better return on its investment. With the EU and climate, the profit motive must always apply. These countries have committed to spending this money to further reduce their own emissions, which is welcome. Had we made different choices, we might have been in their position. Irish taxpayers are big losers in this and we are paying a high price but it is important to acknowledge that we are not the biggest losers. The biggest losers here are the poorest people on the planet, those who are living at the coalface of the climate crisis, and of course the planet itself and its flora and fauna. No amount of statistical transfers and economic wizardry or commodification of the climate crisis can distract from that.   If this is about money, then we have to agree that it is a complete waste of money. It is an indictment of Government policy and an even greater indictment of Government inaction. To add insult to injury, previous administrations have actively blocked solutions brought forward by Opposition parties in this area, including by my colleague, Deputy Stanley. His Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 would have allowed small-scale production of electricity through solar and wind energy production. It provided that excess electricity produced by small-scale microgenerators, whether households, farms, small businesses, local schools, community groups or the GAA, could be fed into the grid and that this would be paid for. In doing so, it would have provided for energy self-sufficiency and a small return for individuals. That was a win-win scenario but, instead, we are moving at snail’s pace. Deputies need not take my word on this as the issue has been well reported on   We need a step change in approach. We also need to move away from the carbon credit approach and drive down our overall emissions in real and measurable terms. Paying €50 million does not help our environment. Paying €50 million will not build more wind farms in the Irish Sea and increase the State's renewable energy capacity. This €50 million of taxpayers' money is lost today.  I conclude by encouraging a step change in the State's approach to offshore wind energy. In a parliamentary reply to me recently, the Minister stated that the State does not directly own or operate, or plan to own or operate, any such resources. We have massive offshore wind potential. It is imperative that it is not privatised - that it is not a case of moving from big oil to big wind or paying our way out of this crisis. We need to start taking our climate obligations seriously and match the rhetoric with action.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-12-16 09:15:00+00:00	Planning and Development Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	1	Maintaining and adapting the planning process in the midst of Covid-19 is undoubtedly a challenge, particularly in terms of ensuring adequate access to information and opportunities to contribute and participate in the process, be that by way of observation, submission or appeal.  I want to put on the record my concerns in relation to the ongoing review of the Meath county development plan, which is a central and fundamental process and part of our planning system. The plan is at a very advanced stage. Covid-19 has meant the development plan process is prolonged and is happening in a hybrid manner online and offline simultaneously. I am not for one second suggesting that people are not doing their best in difficult circumstances but there is, in my opinion, a failure to understand the nature of local government representation in Ireland. Many councillors are part-time, and most of them are holding down full-time or part-time work as well, some of it deemed essential. As a result, we have councillors missing votes, voting online while at work and, quite concerningly, in at least one case in Meath being reported to the Garda for Covid non-compliance for trying to do the work of development plan deliberation, which involves thrashing out issues. I am of the opinion that it can be done this way, but it cannot be done right this way. I ask the Minister to re-evaluate and assess the process that is being undertaken in terms of county development plan reviews, in particular the current Meath county development plan review.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-13 12:00:00+00:00	Covid 19 (Health): Statements	1	In fairness, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did provide the Minister with some time to respond but he did not use it. That was the way I saw it.  I want to focus my contribution on the issue of travel restrictions onto the island and into the State. At the outset I want to highlight that in our opinion the checks at our ports and airports today are wholly inadequate and have been since March. I welcome the announcement last night that a negative or not detected PCR test would be required for people arriving from all countries. That is an extremely late development but nevertheless it is an improvement.  Since last March Sinn Féin has been asking the Government to bring in strict checks and controls at our points of entry but successive Governments have resisted it at every opportunity. Month after month various spokespersons, myself included, have asked for airport testing, a robust passenger locator form and follow-up and it has not happened. As a result of that our points of entry have become a weak point in the national effort against Covid-19. We were forever getting lectures about the nature of testing, false negatives, false positives and the assessments that were being conducted of testing regimes but we had no action until we had 6,000 cases a day. That is a bad way to do policy.  The truth of the matter is that the measures announced last night should have been introduced a long time ago. If we were to listen to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, we should have introduced them when the numbers were low. That is when checks and controls at our ports and airports are increasingly effective and important. That said, while the new PCR testing requirement is extremely late in the day it is welcome but more needs to be done. Foreign travel must be restricted to only those cases that are essential at this time.  Sinn Féin firmly believes that testing post-arrival should be mandatory as the current voluntary system is insufficient. All the Minister has to do is listen to himself and his Government colleagues in respect of what he said about a pre-departure test. He said that a single negative PCR test, whether taken prior to travel or on arrival, does not exclude the presence of disease due to the incubation period. That was true then; it is true now. I appreciate that there are additional regulations in respect of quarantine but in truth they are not being implemented. We do not have a monitored quarantine or self-isolation regime. We do not have adequate follow-up on our passenger locator form. When I submitted to the transport committee that only 18% of people received a follow-up call for their passenger locator form NPHET queried it and I had to show it that it was the Minister's Department that confirmed those statistics. It is wholly inadequate. We need a post-arrival PCR test. We need monitored and rigorously tracked and traced follow-up of the passenger locator form or we will continue to have a weakness at our ports and airports.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-20 10:00:00+00:00	Pay for Student Nurses and Midwives: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy Cullinane for bringing forward the motion. It is timely and important. It is a motion about fairness and equality, about a decent day's pay for a decent day's work, but most of all it is about recognition and respect.  Student nurses will forgive me for using my time to speak on behalf of their front-line colleagues in the laboratory, medical scientists, because like student nurses, all nurses, public health doctors and so many across the health service, medical scientists are knocking at the Minister for Health's door and at the door of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, looking for recognition and respect. Medical scientists have performed heroics during Covid-19 and they have done it while delivering an uninterrupted routine and emergency service 24-7, 365 days a year. Despite this heroic effort, a headline in the media less than a week ago announced the threat of strike action from this group of workers. The chairperson of their union said the last thing any medical scientist wants is to be forced into this situation.  Laboratory services are hanging on by a thread. Medical scientists want recognition of their qualification, ability and contribution. I outlined this to the Minister before. All have degrees and many have masters degrees as standard. Others go further and do PhDs or take the fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, FRC, path, largely for their own personal development. The truth is that the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and their respective Ministers ensure a glass ceiling is imposed. Fifteen years into a 40-year career, they say a person can go no further. There is no opportunity for career progression and, as a result, significant potential goes untapped. While colleagues in Britain and elsewhere are taking on senior clinical and academic responsibilities up to and including consultant grade, medical scientists here are stymied. To add insult to injury, medical scientists have lived with the disrespect of pay inequality for decades. They work side by side doing the exact same work as clinical biochemists but are paid less. We wonder why we have a recruitment and retention crisis and the threat of strike action. There is a major opportunity here.  There is significant investment by the State in the public health service but we are not using it wisely. We have the equipment and the technology, but most of all we have the people, to be a world leader in medical and biomedical research and practice. We have scientists champing at the bit to take on advanced clinical roles, but the Government and departmental bureaucracy stops them in their tracks. I urge the Minister not to look this gift horse in the mouth and to grasp the opportunity, engage and address the needs of medical scientists.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-20 10:00:00+00:00	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	1	I raise the issue of our quarantine and self-isolation regime as it applies to international travellers. This issue has come up time and again. We heard further reports at the weekend about the lack of follow-up on passenger locator forms, the information given when people were followed up on and the quality of the information coming back. It strikes me as a huge loophole and a gap in our ability to be confident that defences against Covid-19 are in place. Are there plans on behalf of the Government to address this issue? Do those plans include a mandatory regime and putting such a regime on a statutory footing? Is the Government actively considering the possibility of quarantine hotels?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-21 10:00:00+00:00	Brexit (Foreign Affairs): Statements	1	I want to focus on the issues of logistics, strategic connectivity and supply chains. There have been significant changes and some finger-pointing but it should be recognised that the issue of Brexit is hugely complex. In recent days, I have met a number of hauliers who outlined some issues they have with the lived experience of the current systems. There are unaccompanied trailers and they are getting information that they have been red routed just 30 minutes before they are due to pick up the trailers. There are examples of lorries being red routed for three days, meaning a 69-year-old has had to spend that time in tractor units that are not fit for purpose and not designed for overnight use. There is talk about systems where there is a need to transcribe manually 15-digit figures, talk about being shifted from terminal to terminal for inspection at Dublin Port, for example, from T11 to T10 to T7, and talk about phone numbers that just ring out. There is huge criticism of the IMDO report, which they say undermined the effort to secure additional ferry connectivity with the Continent. Again, there is the ask in regard to PSOs in terms of direct connectivity to the Continent, given the ferries are not there yet and there is a need for more capacity because existing ferries are overbooked. There is huge concern in regard to groupage, given the situation in Britain, and lorries are coming back but are not able to pick up back-loads because of the complexities of the new bureaucracy. There are also issues in regard to rules of origin.  There is a huge crisis. We should recognise that the average size of a haulage company in Ireland is 5.5 lorries, and there is a big challenge in terms of being in a position to deal with the new administrative burdens. The business model for many of these companies is up in the air. There are significant risks to the businesses themselves and also, from the State's perspective, there is significant risk to vital connectivity and to supply chains.  Will the Minister outline the model that will be in place to refine and improve these processes? There is significant duplication. There needs to be an acknowledgement that we are in the early stages of these new processes and there should be the opportunity to refine and improve them. Will stakeholders be involved in that process?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-21 10:00:00+00:00	Brexit (Foreign Affairs): Statements	2	Okay. I have two questions. There is a specific ask in regard to a six-month adjustment period, which is happening in Britain but is not happening here, reflecting the complexity of the situation. I also have a specific request in regard to the Brexit adjustment fund. Is it decided how it is going to be used? Can it be used for investment in the freight, distribution and logistics sector and to support haulage companies and for investment in port infrastructure, including traffic management systems? Will that be done on an all-Ireland basis, as said by my colleague?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-01-27 10:00:00+00:00	Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	1	The Bill is welcome because it seeks to tackle aspects of white-collar crime, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and specific offences against the EU's financial interests. We know the complex VAT fraud and what are known as carousel fraud operations have used shell companies and banks here. Of course, they have been unwittingly involved, but criminal enterprises have used Irish banks to commit serious offences. Therefore, it is right that Ireland plays its part as a member state and implements this legislation in order to give effect to the EU directive. We know that these types of crimes cost EU taxpayers billions of euros every year. It is important that we do all we can to prevent this. Successive governments have been reluctant to strengthen our domestic white-collar crime legislation but, as my colleague mentioned, the legislation to overhaul the ODCE is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny, which is very welcome.  The reform of the ODCE is much needed and well overdue. Sinn Féin has been consistent in its criticism of the hands-off approach of the Government to white-collar crime here. It is scandalous that ten years after the bank bailout, the need for which arose as a result of the reckless behaviour of banking executives, the agency tasked with monitoring compliance with company law has a staff of just 44. The need for a total overhaul of the ODCE came to the fore in 2017 when the trial of the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank collapsed due to the nature and performance of the investigation of the ODCE. At the time, Judge Aylmer said that the investigation carried out by the ODCE fell short of an unbiased, impartial and balanced investigation to which the accused in any case is entitled. The coaching of witnesses in respect of their statements, the late disclosure of documents, a perceived bias on the part of ODCE investigators and the shredding of documents were all cited as reasons that the trial of the accused could not be considered to be fair. It was, in effect, a damning indictment of the State's apparatus to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime. Almost four years on, however, we are still waiting for the new overhauled agency. The limited staff, funding and powers conferred on the ODCE over decades epitomises the lack of interest that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have in tackling white-collar crime. I look forward to the overhaul of the ODCE. We will seek to ensure that this office has the full capability it needs to pursue and prosecute white-collar criminals.  The Bill before us is welcome because it provides more protections for EU taxpayers in the context of fraud and misappropriation. The need for our laws in this area to be regularly updated was highlighted by a case involving Meath County Council a couple of years ago. I was a member of that local authority at the time. The council was a victim of what is known as CEO fraud, whereby large sums are transferred online to criminals on foot of a bogus instruction in the name of a company chief executive. Fortunately, the €4.3 million involved in that case was recovered when the money was frozen in a bank account in Hong Kong after the Garda interrupted the operation. That and other cases highlight the need for regular reviews of our laws to take account of new forms of fraud and cybercrime. They also highlight the importance of working with international colleagues due to the nature of sophisticated online crime.  I welcome the Bill but I ask that the Minister for Justice to further strengthen and update domestic legislation to tackle white-collar crime and to ensure that white-collar criminals face the full legal consequences of their actions, which many have escaped to date.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-10 10:00:00+00:00	Covid-19 (Transport and Travel): Statements	1	I will focus my comments and questions on international travel and the aviation sector and colleagues will pick up on other issues.  The British Government's announcement on the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine from Monday next completely exposed the Irish Government's excuses and delays in this area. Mandatory hotel quarantine can be done and there is no reason it should not be done here for all non-essential arrivals. The advice from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has been crystal clear on this. They stated, as recently as 14 January, that the discretionary elements of quarantine and post-arrival testing should be removed. They also stated that every effort should be made to remove these. Neither direction has been followed. Yet again, the public health advice has been shelved during this pandemic. While the Administration in London announced detailed plans for self-funded ten-day quarantines with strict measures and severe penalties for breaches, the Minister and his colleagues are still at the stage of confusion and indecision. It also announced mandatory testing for all travellers on days two and eight post arrival, something that Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for in Ireland but that the Government has inexplicitly resisted.  We have had nearly a year of inadequate and reactionary measures on international travel that have protected neither lives nor livelihoods. Every measure introduced to date has been half-baked. On 1 June, Sinn Féin stated that a traffic light system for international travel should be examined. Unbelievably, we had to wait until November before it was introduced, and then only at the behest of the EU. The Government waited until the passenger locator form was ignored   It is incredible that NPHET issued advice on 14 January, the Government responded and within hours, its proposals and measures were proven inadequate. I cannot understand how no lessons have been learned. The Government is constantly on the back foot as regards international travel. Leaving our ports of entry wide open during a pandemic has not benefited anyone over the past year. It has not helped aviation workers, kept the travel sector afloat, kept out Covid variants or reduced infections on our island. We know there are combined variants with increased infectivity, transmissibility and mortality levels associated with them.  The Government's measures have not worked and will not work. It needs to go back to the drawing board yet again. A system of hotel quarantine for all non-essential arrivals needs to be introduced immediately until such time as our infection levels drop, our health system is not at risk of being overwhelmed and the vaccine roll-out is more advanced. We realise that this means an extension of the current challenges facing those working in the aviation and travel sectors but decisive action now, with adequate sector-specific supports, will help these industries recover more quickly. Britain is introducing mandatory quarantine for arrivals from 33 countries, covering 800 million people. The Government has stated that it intends to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for arrivals from just two countries, Brazil and South Africa, at some future date as yet unknown.  Has the Minister's counterpart in London been in contact with him about Ireland being used as a back door into Britain to avoid the latter's quarantine measures? When will the Government introduce a more comprehensive list of countries to which hotel quarantine will apply?

It is not a year-on-year comparison. The risk is a real one, given the numbers coming through. If we do not have an adequate system of checks and controls, it will not matter how few are travelling here. All that matters is how many come to Ireland with Covid, particularly its variants.  I wish to raise the related issue of the aviation and travel sectors and the supports for same, given the public health measures' significant impact on them. The Government's approach has not just failed to protect the population from further infection but has also done no favours for the aviation and travel sectors. Pilots, cabin crew, ground staff and travel agents have raised issues. They appeared before a committee yesterday. Significant proposals have been made. The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has pointed to other countries. For example, there has been a $900 million investment in Air New Zealand. Air France has got €7 billion and Lufthansa €10 billion. Fórsa, SIPTU and Connect Trade Union pointed towards a sector-specific intervention and supports based on the German model. When I asked parliamentary questions last week, I was given no figures for the supports for individual airlines. I read in the newspapers that the figure was €150 million. Is that the case and has it been provided? What scale of support is available for individual airlines and, as importantly, workers in the sector? What will the Government do?

My office, as I am sure is the case in the offices of Members around the country, has been contacted by people who are fearful of the impact this will have on their day-to-day living costs, particularly when one considers utility bills and cost of living expenses. Will the decision be reviewed?  There is another element to this that affects people who have already been asked to pay. The Department of Social Protection is not talking to Revenue because it cannot get statements of accounts. Assumptions are then made by Revenue that distinctly disadvantage people who are being asked to pay this tax at a much higher level than is reflective of what they received.

We have been advised that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has stated that a permit application from an operator may follow shortly after the commencement of this section of the 1995 Act, which relates to the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas installations. I would like more information on that and the potential impact it may have on our marine environment. Will we have an opportunity to consider and debate this issue or will that responsibility lie entirely with the EPA?  On water pollution, I read over the debate in the Dáil on the Dumping at Sea Act in 1995. It was interesting to note that the Act introduced a prohibition on the dumping of sewage sludge from vessels at sea. It was stated in the Dáil at the time that the ""dumping around our coast of raw sewage into the sea can no longer be tolerated"". While it was of course right to ban the disposal of raw sewage at sea by ships, 25 years on we continue to pump sewage from the mainland into the seas off our coasts. The EPA's 2020 report found that raw sewage was flowing into our rivers and seas in 35 places in the State. This is a serious public health and environmental issue that stems from the State's historical failure to invest in waste water treatment facilities over the course of decades. It must be addressed as a matter of priority.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who pointed out that those involved in fishing are the custodians of the sea. In many parts of the country, anglers and angling groups are the custodians of our inland waterways. In my town of Kells, the Kells Anglers Association has done tremendous work in looking after the Blackwater river and the people involved have a forensic knowledge of the river.  On the issue of offshore wind farms, when this Act was introduced oil rigs off our coast were common and legislation was needed to govern that area but offshore wind farms were not as common. They are a more recent phenomenon. The next decade will see a significant increase in the construction of offshore wind farms, first in the Irish Sea and then, hopefully, that will be followed in the south and west coasts. These construction projects are vital in helping Ireland to achieve our renewable energy targets, reduce our carbon emissions and also position our island to become an exporter of green energy to the EU. This development will give rise to questions regarding the responsible construction of these installations, their impact on the marine environment and the plans for the future when these wind farms may need to be decommissioned or replaced. Has the Minister examined this issue specifically with regard to offshore wind installations? If so, he might address whether this legislation is adequate for this area. It is a prospect which we need to grab with both hands. "

The extension was necessary and welcome. Taxi drivers understood the measure was being further extended to the end of 2021 but it now appears that, instead of being extended further, the measure was replicated. In effect, they could benefit from a one-year extension and then that was it. The implication is twofold. Drivers who have made little or no money in the past 12 months but whose cars fell for renewal last year must now replace their cars. They are also being denied the €150 waiver in respect of the suitability test. Will the Tánaiste engage with the Minister for Transport on these issues, please?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-18 10:00:00+00:00	Covid-19 (Enterprise, Trade and Employment): Statements	1	I raise the impact the pandemic has had on those working in the aviation and travel sectors across Ireland. Covid-19 and its necessary restrictions have had a devastating impact on the sector. Protecting public health is the number one priority but we must also think of the essential role of aviation and travel. It employs 140,000 directly and indirectly and is vital to our island's connectivity and to our society and economy.  Without putting too fine a point on it, workers in the sector have no faith in a Green Party Minister to protect them. The Oireachtas committee is ably chaired by the Tánaiste's party colleague, the previous speaker, Deputy O'Donnell. The committee has engaged extensively with the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, Fórsa, SIPTU, Connect and other unions in the sector. We have also met with the airports, airlines and travel agents, and to a man and woman, these organisations are adamant that better support for their industry is needed. They are calling for sector-specific supports to recognise the massive hit the aviation sector has suffered, direct State investment in airports and airlines, and a German-style support package for workers. They point towards the scale and type of supports in other countries. It is no coincidence that a number of speakers have raised this issue with the Tánaiste. I am encouraged by the responses so far. I ask that the Tánaiste would reaffirm that commitment to support the sector and the jobs within it, notwithstanding the challenges that are there.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-24 10:00:00+00:00	Health (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. To begin, I must ask why the Minister for Transport is not here taking this Bill through the House. Where is the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today? He should be anchoring this Bill but he is missing in action. I mean no disrespect to the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, but their responsibility and focus should be entirely on the health system and the critical vaccination roll-out. It is wholly inappropriate that the hotel quarantine Bill was loaded on the Department of Health. It is clear the Bill was dumped on the Minister, which is absolutely not helpful. It was a selfish move by the Minister's Cabinet colleagues, who shirked their responsibility in this area.  While Sinn Féin welcomes the broad thrust of this Bill, and I thank the departmental officials for their briefing on Monday, it will come as no surprise to hear we do not believe this Bill goes far enough. NPHET set the bar on 14 January when it recommended ""that every effort be made to ensure that discretion as it currently applies to the need for restriction of movements and PCR-testing post-arrival in Ireland is removed"". The question is whether we can do more to limit discretion on restriction of movements and PCR testing post arrival. When we look at this Bill and the wider regime, the answer is absolutely clear. Yes, we can; yes, we should; and yes, we must.  Limiting the provisions of this Bill to arrivals from just 20 countries is wholly inadequate. One of our amendments seeks to extend mandatory hotel quarantine to arrivals from all  Central to the Government's argument against our proposals is that it wants to continue with the approach of reacting to variants or outbreaks in other countries as they arise. This does not work and will not work. The Government has stated, as if it were a badge of honour, that on first hearing of the British variant it imposed a travel ban the next day. What decisive action. While this is how the Government intends to carry on, did it work? It did not, not by a million miles, as 90% of all cases here are now from that exact variant.  The Minister knows that by the time variants are discovered in other countries, it is too late and the ship has sailed, both literally and figuratively. The Government's plan runs contrary to the fundamental principles of outbreak management and prevention. For 170 or 180-odd countries in the world, we will rely on mandatory quarantine at home. Let us just be straight with people. There is no such thing as mandatory quarantine at home. It is a misnomer and does not exist. It cannot be monitored or enforced. It is mandatory in name only and is quarantine in name only. It means nothing and as a result, this entire plan is wholly inadequate.  This is why the collective Opposition and the vast majority of people are asking for proactive measures in this regard. That is why nothing less than including all countries in this will work. We must take a cautious approach until the vaccination programme is more advanced and more information about variants is known. The Government acknowledges this and we must take measures that will help allow our population get back to some level of normal life. The best way to do that is to drive the virus down and to prevent it and new variants from reseeding. Closing the door to unchecked international travel for the time being should be one part of this plan. Sinn Féin’s amendments deliver that and I urge the Minister to reconsider his position.  Related to the need for more comprehensive mandatory hotel quarantine is the urgent need to expand the checks and balances currently in place. Number one must be the introduction of a mandatory PCR test post arrival for all non-essential travel. A pre-departure test within the previous 72 hours, as currently required, is not enough. The Minister knows this and the experts have told him. NPHET's modelling indicates that even the best-performing pre-departure Covid-19 tests will miss up to 40% of cases within that 72-hour period. We have submitted another amendment that would require a post-arrival test for all non-essential travellers, regardless of whether they are in hotel quarantine. The Minister should accept it.  Currently, people are arriving back into the State and possibly quarantining in their homes. They are mixing with family members or housemates and without testing post arrival, this has the potential to lead to significant numbers of clusters. Post-arrival mandatory testing must be introduced. It is about closing the net and managing and minimising the risk. We have all heard about the Swiss cheese model and the layers of protection. Pre-departure testing will miss up to 40% of cases. When combined with a post-arrival test on day 5, it will miss up to 15% of cases, according to the submission of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication Networks. It is true that 15% is much better than 40%. NPHET set the bar, and on the issue of post-arrival testing, the Minister has not even tied his laces.  It is a similar case with the practicalities of the proposed regime. Given the current state of affairs, it will happen in very limited circumstances and maybe none but technically, someone landing in Belfast and living in the South is expected to voluntarily present at a designated facility. The question arises as to what happens if one does not. There are fines and penalties, which is fair enough. However, to ensure that this measure is implementable and enforceable, passenger data must be shared in real time between Belfast and Dublin, in order that the authorities here know who should be presenting at a designated facility and can contact them if they do not. It makes sense and we have submitted an amendment in this regard. I ask the Minister to support it.  Finally, we must acknowledge the impact that all of this will have on the aviation sector. I was genuinely taken aback to hear the response of the Tánaiste in the House last week when I raised this matter with him. In a highly disingenuous way, he suggested that asking for mandatory hotel quarantine and advocating for support for the aviation sector was trying to have it both ways. That is absolute nonsense. Of course, we realise that extra measures will add further to the difficulties in the aviation and travel sectors but look at those industries now. Look at what the Government's policies have achieved. The summer of 2020 was lost and now we are being told that the summer of 2021 will be lost. If we do not get ahead of this virus, more months and jobs will be lost.  Government half-measures and this permanent purgatory will not do. The Government’s approach to aviation has been disgraceful. It has failed to support the sector and its workers. The level of State supports is a fraction of what is required. The Government has turned a blind eye to ghost flights leaving with people’s money. We are told that nothing can be done. It has turned a blind eye to loyal customers being given the runaround on refunds and vouchers and being gouged on rescheduling fees. It has turned a blind eye on loyal workers being denied their short-time work support and to Aer Lingus strategically moving its operations elsewhere. The Minister wrote to me this morning, stating that the privatisation of Aer Lingus is ""a positive evolution for the company"". That is absolutely incredible. It is completely outrageous for the Tánaiste to come into the Dáil and claim that this half-baked plan, which is in front of us today, is about protecting aviation. It is no wonder that aviation sector workers are at their wits' end.   The Government cannot continue to ignore the need for crucial protections for workers. Tailored supports must be introduced for workers in the aviation industry who are facing months more of uncertainty and possible further job losses. The Government is sitting on a quarter of a billion euro in the so-called connectivity fund. This must be used. Massive investment is needed to protect aviation. It should come with conditions, including the protection of workers, jobs, strategic connectivity, and delivery on climate change goals. The Government has the power to do this. The Minister should stop pretending that there is some happy balance to be struck somewhere between 20 and 200-odd countries. It is an insult to ordinary workers who are looking to the Minister and the Government for hope. Instead, they are being used as a political football.  This legislation is important. It has come very late but at a crucial juncture in our effort to get ahead of this virus. Sinn Féin has proposed a number of amendments. I ask the Minister to consider and adopt them."

I support several of the amendments. Amendment No. 31 is in my name and that of Deputy Cullinane.  I will echo several comments made thus far regarding the analysis that the Government's approach to this issue not being a serious one. It strikes me that the evidence shows that this Government dragged along in this regard. It has not just been this Government but the previous one as well. I remember discussing with the then Minister, Shane Ross, the need to improve measures regarding international travel at our ports and airports. Every step of the way, Sinn Féin has called for the Government of the day to implement stricter measures. We can track that process over time.   Let us recall the introduction of the passenger locator form. It was initially a voluntary measure but that caused a media furore. Out of embarrassment, the Government then made the passenger locator form mandatory. The Government then continuously failed to follow up in this regard. Several Deputies tracked this situation over time and the follow-up has been pathetic to the extent that it raises serious questions about the Government's commitment to and seriousness about having the passenger locator form as an effective measure.  What was the passenger locator form? It was the Government's tool to monitor adherence to quarantine and restriction of movement measures. The Government essentially turned a blind eye at every turn. Even when the Government was embarrassed by the figures which were made public, it did nothing to improve that situation. Those figures regarding adherence in respect of passenger locator forms ranged at various times from 7% to 18%. Some people got a follow-up call, but most people did not. Those people who got a follow-up call were not really obliged to do anything, including not even having to give accurate information. It was a tick-box effort. In fairness, the passenger locator forms then moved online and there was greater adherence to completing them in the first instance but it was not a measure the Government was really serious about.  The same thing could be said about the experience over time in respect of testing. My own background is in medical science and I could not believe the Government's reluctance to introduce a testing regime at our ports and airports. I raised this matter for months with various Ministers and all I got was an outline of what would happen in the future. Reference was made to all the considerations necessary, the weaknesses of testing and the complications to be taken into account. Under significant pressure, the Government did eventually introduce a testing regime before Christmas. That testing regime was voluntary and expensive. A mandatory testing regime was only introduced when we had in the region of 8,000 cases a day.   The test that was introduced was one undertaken 72 hours pre-departure. As NPHET has said about tests conducted 72 hours pre-departure, if I am going away, I can get a PCR test now, have my going away party, mingle with as many people as I like wherever I am and then I can still turn up at the airport in a couple of days' time with my negative PCR test. That is the weakness of that measure. It is acknowledged that test will miss in the region of 40% of cases and that is a statement of scientific fact. The Government and NPHET know that but they are still insistent that we not have a mandatory, across-the-board, post-arrival PCR testing regime in place. In fact, Sinn Féin submitted an amendment to this Bill, which has been ruled out of order, that specifically requested the introduction of a mandatory, across-the-board, post-arrival PCR testing regime. It was ruled out of order because it might be a charge on the Exchequer. That is simply incredible.  In its letter of 14 January, NPHET requested ""every effort be made to ensure that discretion as it currently applies to the need for restriction of movements and PCR testing post-arrival in Ireland is removed"". We have done nothing on the second aspect because we are afraid it might have a cost on the Exchequer. Regarding making every effort to address discretion on the restriction of movement, that is why the Opposition is broadly speaking with one voice regarding this group of amendments on this matter. The premise of the Government's approach is that we will look at other countries, see when virus variants arise which are of concern and then consider the situation on an ongoing basis. We know, however, that the real world does not operate that way. At that stage, it is too late.  The Government is looking for credit in this regard. The Minister for Transport referred to this point earlier, and it is contained in the Government's new living with Covid-19 document published only a few days ago.  It was a case of saying look at how we quickly we responded when the British variant was identified but that is an example of why we need mandatory hotel quarantine for all countries, not just a limited number. We heard the Taoiseach outlining the difficulty with implementing and enforcing mandatory quarantine at home. He asked how it could be done, how we could check whether people were in their bedrooms. It cannot be done and that is the case for mandatory hotel quarantine across the board. We need to recognise that we are in a particular set of circumstances. We are not back in May, in the summer or even before Christmas. There are variants in the community and there is vaccine in the community, and that is the perfect environment for the development of vaccine-resistant variants. We really need to do something about that and we are in a position to do so, but we are not taking that decision here.  The British variant is now rampant in Ireland, as we know, and there is now the Bristol variant. We know that the South African variant is on the island, although we do not know to what extent. It is completely false to suggest that we know we have quashed it. We do not know the extent of it and have not genome-sequenced enough people. Furthermore, we do not know who may or may not have it in the community because of the limitations of our testing regime. The South African variant is cropping up in parts of London, from where direct flights arrive here every day, and there is also the Californian variant, with flights arriving from the United States a number of times a week.  In that context, we know we have to go further than is being proposed, which is why the Opposition is speaking with such a united voice. If the Government's argument is turned on its head, to look at what is not being done, it follows the logic of what Deputies have been saying. The Bill is tokenism, a box-ticking exercise, and is not a real effort to deliver on a public health objective. That we do not have a timeline of when the measures will be introduced gives rise to further concern.  I highlight the opportunity we have now, as we had last summer. It was mentioned earlier that we essentially won the battle against Covid in this State last summer. We got down to single-digit figures. I recall those great days, reported on television and radio, when there were zero new cases. We have seen the publication from Professor Paddy Mallon and the genome-sequencing group that mapped the variants over time and throughout the country. The Teagasc website contains really interesting information in that regard. It emphasises the need to take measures to grasp this opportunity and to go further than is being proposed in the Bill.  I call on the Minister to change tack and to recognise the logic of the argument being made by the Opposition and the considerable public support and demand. The public see the absolute contradiction and it is an insult to them and their efforts, and to the sacrifices that families and businesses have been making. We have had the longest lockdown in Europe and people do not see a return for it. They see the absolute contradiction of people taking advantage of the lax regime that is in place. I call on the Minister to change tack, to recognise the opportunity and to take on board the proposals of the Opposition."

There is robust evidence for poor outcomes in Covid-19 in the presence of pre-existing heart failure. This is for hospitalised patients and patients in the community. I can send the references to the Minister. I understand the HSE's national heart programme has made submissions to the NIAC advisory group on cardiovascular patients. It believes they need to be placed in allocation group four. These are heart failure patients under 70 years of age and patients waiting in-house for cardiovascular surgery. The national heart programme believes an error has been made. Will the Minister seek a further review of the vaccine priority list given this error? When will this happen?

I could list many cases of families, renters and homeowners, who are pensioners in some cases, who live in cold homes that are D-rated or worse. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland was with them a decade ago so they will not see it again, such are the rules. There is no funding for windows or doors. These people are not in a position to avail of other subsidies because they do not have disposable income but they are promised that they might be one of 500,000 deep retrofits by 2030. I welcome the ambition but I firmly believe that we need a plan in place to support those people who are most in need between now and 2030. My concern is that the ambition is way out in the future and in the interim people will live in homes that are D-rated and worse, with no real proposition of improving windows, doors or attic insulation. It is a matter of prioritisation for those most in need.

This is a simple, straightforward Bill that tackles an important issue. The Bill would give the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications the power to introduce a ban on gas and electricity disconnections over the fuel allowance season, which runs from October to April each year. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is the independent regulator in this area. While it is independent, section 10(1) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 allows for the Minister to give it policy direction.  This Bill inserts a new section to make it explicit that this policy direction can extend to the introduction of a moratorium on disconnections during the winter months. While there is a voluntary code and the CRU has introduced a disconnection ban throughout level 5 restrictions, which is welcome, we want to ensure that these protections are afforded to people every winter. In the same way that workers and families are facing financial difficulties during the current pandemic and should not have their power or heating cut off, thousands of households find themselves in the same difficult financial position each winter and they deserve the same protections.  In 2019, a total of 5,008 households had their electricity disconnected for non-payment and 2,424 gas customers were disconnected. At a time when utility charges, including gas and electricity, are increasing, and public service obligations, carbon taxes and the price of fuel are increasing, household incomes are not keeping pace. Our Bill would give households breathing space and allow them to come to a payment arrangement with their supplier while ensuring they do not have their heating and lights cut off. Even having the threat of disconnections hanging over families is incredibly stressful. Other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium all have similar disconnection bans. This vital protection should also be introduced here.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-21 10:00:00+01:00	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	1	I want to raise the case of Anne Kelly. Anne is 86 years old and is housebound in Ashbourne, County Meath. She is waiting for her Covid vaccine and getting more anxious by the day. She feels like she has been forgotten about. She could be forgiven for this because, in this Chamber on 25 March, a month ago, the Minister said the first phase of the vaccination programme for the housebound was completed in Dublin and the north-east. Mrs. Kelly has not had her vaccine and is distraught. She spent Easter Sunday in tears according to her daughter, Adrienne, who is a fantastic advocate and who, like others, can get no answers. By everyone's Covid-19 measure, the housebound are the most vulnerable. Age is the defining risk factor. The lack of information is very frustrating. Are there 3,000, 1,000 or 300 on the list? All of these figures have been quoted in the past week. Could the Taoiseach please give Anne Kelly and others in the same position some hope, show them they are not forgotten about and tell us when they will get the vaccine?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-21 10:00:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill. We have already had one vote on it and we will have plenty of discussion and many more votes. It is acknowledged this Bill benefited greatly from the pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Climate Action before Christmas, which was ably chaired by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Leddin. The climate committee members worked on a cross-party basis, heard from a wide range of experts, in private and public, and made 78 recommendations to the Minister with a view to improving and strengthening this Bill. Many of these recommendations have been incorporated in the Bill before us today, which is welcome. However, while this version is a considerable improvement on the draft Bill, we believe there is room for further improvement, and we will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.  This is landmark legislation which will outlive any one Administration, so it is important we get it right at this stage. It is important to set the targets and the framework to get us there. The Minister will have received correspondence in recent days from Professors John Sweeney and Barry McMullin and Dr. Andrew Jackson outlining some concerns about the Bill, principally its failure, legally or scientifically, to place the commitment of the programme for Government for the period 2021 to 2030 on a secure statutory basis. They argue the language used in section 9 is legally uncertain and could give rise to contradictory interpretations. Given the limited time I have and the fact the Minister has no doubt read the letter and considered its contents, I will not articulate its contents in full but I ask that he might, in his concluding remarks, address the points raised in it and whether he intends to amend the section accordingly.  The shift in public awareness on climate issues and the appetite for change in recent years has been a really positive development. The youth climate strikes that took place globally and across Ireland before Covid-19, demonstrated the desire for our younger generations for a significant step change in how the State and the private sector approach our environment and deal with the climate crisis. It is essential we listen to people on climate action. It is often noted the public are usually ahead of politicians on issues, and none more so than the need to address the climate emergency. People want change. They want green energy, warmer homes, better transport, cleaner air and unpolluted rivers, but they also want this transition to zero carbon to be fair. This is where this and previous Governments have failed. People know this transition will take personal change on their behalf, but they want to see the Government pulling its weight and big polluters doing their share of the heavy lifting, and that has not been happening to date.  Ordinary people have been an easy target for the Government, and they have been hit again and again. Ask most people what they think of when they hear climate action and reducing our emissions and many will answer it is one cost after another, in rural and in urban Ireland: carbon tax, higher electricity and heating bills, and increased fuel costs at the forecourts. They will also point out how major corporations and vested interests have shirked their responsibilities, enabled by light touch regulation. Take electricity use. Hundreds of thousands of families live in fuel and energy poverty, struggling to keep the electricity bills down as a result of the huge carbon tax and public service obligation levy increases this year, but then they see data centres that use enough energy to power a town springing up with reckless abandon. Government action to date has not been fair or equitable when it comes to reducing our overall emissions. Ordinary people feel they are hit again and again while others continue to get a free ride. That has to change, and if it does not, we will fail.  Climate action does not have to have such negative connotations for people; indeed, quite the opposite. It can deliver huge benefits. It can and should bring about progressive change and transformation: new green jobs, warmer homes, better health outcomes, cheaper and cleaner ways of getting to school or work, cleaner air and rivers, greater connection to place and community and to the environment, additional income for local communities and businesses through selling excess wind energy, and the list goes on.  While this Bill is about the framework governing the targets and reductions and does not deal with the specific measures that will help us achieve them, the specific measures must be inclusive in rural and urban Ireland, they must be fair and they must ensure a just transition is always a priority. This approach must also extend to jobs that will be lost due to our transition to green energy. The ESB’s announcement earlier this month on its Green Atlantic at Moneypoint plan provides an example of how this shift can not only protect jobs but also bring significant new investment and potential to a region. The €5 billion plan to convert the coal power plant into a green energy hub, together with offshore floating wind and green hydrogen production and storage facilities, is an incredibly impressive plan that, if delivered, will bring huge benefits to the region as well as ensuring workers at Moneypoint and in the local community are not left behind as the burning of coal ends. We can and should be leaders in this field.  Workers in Bord na Móna and the midlands, by comparison, have been failed miserably by successive governments. They have been sold a green pup or a climate pup. As peat production winds up in the midlands, we need government intervention and financial support to ensure workers there are supported with new training and new opportunities. That has to happen or we are lost.  I welcome the provisions that seek to engage the public on our climate approach and seek people's input and views. However, more public consultation that acts as just a box-ticking exercise and ignores what is put forward by ordinary people will be a total waste of everyone’s time. Engagement must be meaningful. There will not always be agreement but it is about working with the public, respecting them and bringing them along. In my constituency, the North-South interconnector is a case in point. It is an important piece of energy infrastructure. The public want it but want it underground. For 15 years, they have been making that case. It is entirely feasible but EirGrid and successive Governments have preferred to bully local communities rather than engage with them. Where is that project? It is nowhere, and that is where it is going to stay unless EirGrid and the Government change tack. The communities along the route are still adamant that they do not want 50 m high pylons carrying 400 kV lines next to their homes, but EirGrid and the Government have ignored public opinion and the clear evidence which shows the underground alternative is technically feasible, affordable and deliverable. In fact, it is the only way this project will be delivered. The approach has infuriated local communities and only serves to paralyse important projects. No amount of propaganda or advertising expenditure can hide that. I ask the Minister to learn from this. What is being done is no way of doing business. If he continues in this vein, we will not have a hope of meeting our emissions and renewables targets. It will be a constant battle between communities and the Government instead of collaboration.  As my party's transport spokesperson I am particularly interested in what we need to do to reduce the 20% contribution of the transport sector to our overall emissions. Public transport will be a key aspect, and significant investment in infrastructure, fleet expansion and replacement is needed to accelerate the modal shift from car to bus or train. There is a huge unmet need, including in respect of school bus transport, that the Government seems intent on continuing to ignore. This must be addressed. Similarly, communities in the west have been advocating for the western rail corridor for years and people in Meath, like me, have been arguing for rail transport to Dublin. People want to leave their cars at home but, owing to a lack of investment in public transport for decades, they have little option. These are just a few examples of key public transport interventions that can deliver significant environmental benefits and boost investment in jobs and tourism in areas but that have been bogged down in review after review with no progress.  As mentioned, we will be making several amendments on Committee Stage with a view to addressing shortcomings we believe remain. Some that were already mentioned relate to interim targets. Our amendments will also strengthen the Bill in terms of its obligation to achieve a just transition and provide certainty on the appointments process for the Climate Change Advisory Council and on the issue of fracked gas and the role of the public in shaping their carbon future. I hope there will be an opportunity for further refinement and I look forward to working with the Minister and others from across this House to continue to improve this really important Bill.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-22 10:00:00+01:00	Covid Restrictions Support Scheme Regulations and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme Regulations: Motions	1	I wish to raise a couple of issues with the Minister this afternoon. I ask that the Government look into them as soon as possible as they remain unresolved despite repeated requests for action.  The first issue relates to aviation workers, specifically Aer Lingus employees. My colleague, Teachta O'Reilly, referenced this point. The pandemic and resulting necessary travel restrictions have had a massive impact on workers in the sector. This hardship has been compounded by repeated failures of the social welfare system to support them when they need it most. Last year, we ran into issues where the airline refused to sign forms correctly for workers on the short-term work support scheme. Workers were continuously pushed from pillar to post by the company and the Department for Social Protection. This was eventually resolved for the temporary wages subsidy scheme, TWSS, after we raised it repeatedly with the Minister and with the airline. A satisfactory resolution or fair solution was never found for the EWSS.  Now, cabin crew and other staff are getting notifications from their social welfare offices that their period on jobseeker's benefit is coming to an end and they will have to face a similar further substantial cut in pay in the time head. What has been suggested for them? A further reduction in hours. That is entirely unsatisfactory as a proposal. It is absolutely brutal that this would be suggested. These workers are barely getting by as it is. It is scandalous that the rug is being pulled from under them at this point. They cannot get clarity on it. My colleague, Deputy Clarke, raised the issue with the Tánaiste earlier and, amazingly, he did not seem to understand that a Department, of which he was formerly the head, was responsible for Xs and Os.  We call on the Minister, therefore, to intervene and work with his colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to address this issue as a matter of priority to ensure aviation workers continue to be supported by the wage subsidy scheme, which is welcome, and other necessary social welfare supports. Aviation workers and their unions have called for a German-style wage support. I echo that call here.  My second point relates to another group of transport workers who have been severely impacted over the last 12 months. Taxi drivers have seen their business disappear and their income cut massively. These workers have had to continue to cover expensive overheads for their vehicles and the income supports put in place for them simply do not cover it. Thousands of drivers in the sector are over the age of 66, meaning they are not entitled to the pandemic employment payment, PUP.  We called for tailored supports for this sector to ensure taxi drivers are supported but this request has fallen on deaf ears. In the North, for example, there is a simple, targeted £3,000 grant. The Minister for Transport here seems to be living in a parallel universe to taxi drivers. The suggestion that the main initiative by this Government is a grant for electric vehicles, EV, is simply completely out of touch. A direct and focused support for this sector is needed or it will not survive. It is a case of survival and support rather than cosmetics on the outside.

I have seen it over many years in regards to groups such as the Kells Anglers which have been the custodians of the River Blackwater and look after its stock and quality.  In recent weeks, the communities along the River Boyne rallied in defence of it. In the space of a number of days, over 6,000 people in a small rural area joined an online campaign in support of the environment and the River Boyne. The ""Save the Boyne"" campaign now has over 8,100 followers. There is a planning application that will be judged on its own merits and I will not get into that. I commend the forum and its active members and the local angling clubs, community groups and businesses on their efforts and interest in protecting their environment and on protecting our inland waterways. It was something to be proud of and to be commended.  On their behalf, Government needs to work with these communities and support them. That goes for the Government's agencies as well, in terms of local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Irish Water and other authorities. From my experience as a public representative and working with these communities, they have a mixed experience of working with these agencies that have an official responsibility to protect our natural and built heritage.  On a related point, I raise the Hill of Tara. As the Minister of State knows, it is one of the richest archeological landscapes in Ireland. Over 230,000 people visit the Hill of Tara on an annual basis. I do not live far from it. Increasing numbers of people have visited during Covid-19. Where is the Hill of Tara conservation management plan? It is work in progress since 2018. I commend stakeholders such as the local Rathfeigh Skyne Tara, RST, group and the Friends of Tara group. It is clear what needs to be done to conserve the area, but also to enhance it in terms of public amenities, parking, toilet facilities and interpretive centres. There is significant opportunity which needs to be grasped. I encourage the Minister of State to provide an update and to ensure the work gets done."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-05 12:00:00+01:00	Private Rental Sector: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing it forward. We have a rental market in Ireland that is neither normal nor bearable. In County Meath, rent costs are exorbitant. On   The proposals in this motion would serve to stop renters and the prospect of ever increasing rents being used as a bargaining chip in a big money game. It would ban rent increases and put a month’s rent back in people’s pockets. It would protect renters in a dysfunctional system. It would protect renters while issues of supply were addressed. Covid or no Covid, every day I deal with individuals and families who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness. These are individuals and families, many with school going kids, dealing with council homelessness officers who can do no more and must apologise and tell them they cannot afford to live in this area, that there is nothing more officials can do for them, that there is no other support and that they will need to uproot their whole world and move to some place they have no connection to, know no-one and have no support. That is devastating. It is shameful and is a direct result of decisions made by successive Governments. The rental crisis can be fixed. The Minister should rethink his position on this motion and support it.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-06 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19 Vaccination Programme: Statements	1	Following up on that point, I second Deputy O'Donnell's proposal. I sit on the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks. There is an interesting and important window of opportunity to carry out that pilot study. We have this hybrid model, which I have argued against because I believe it should be stronger, of mandatory hotel quarantine for a specific cohort and a pre-departure PCR test for other people travelling, for instance, from London to Dublin, as well as recommendations and other obligations, but only advice regarding a post-arrival PCR test. What has been proposed here is to add to that serial antigen testing. It would be an interesting study to run over the period of a month. It would provide useful information for the Government in terms of opportunities for the future and could be of benefit in the time ahead. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communication Networks issued a letter on this and held very interesting hearings yesterday with Professor Ferguson. This is a real opportunity and I ask the Minister to respond on it.  The other issue I want to raise is the TRIPS waiver. While I do not want to repeat the questions asked by others on Government commitments, I do want to hear and see such commitments. I am firmly of the position that there is a real opportunity with the TRIPS waiver to increase the supply and reduce the cost of vaccines. The Minister referenced the success of the vaccine roll-out which may be the case from a European or North American perspective but from a global perspective, there are vast swathes of the planet that have not seen any vaccines. Indeed, some countries have not seen a single vaccine dose yet. There is enormous scope for improvement and the TRIPS waiver is part of that. What is the timeframe and at what level are discussions taking place? What is the role of the Irish Government in this? Does the Minister for Health have a role or is this a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach? At what level are those discussions taking place and what is the expected timeframe for a decision?

Taxi drivers are in need of a dedicated survival and recovery package that reflects the challenges in their industry. A number of measures have been introduced but taxi drivers have not been able to avail of the vast majority of them. They got a licence waiver of €150. There has been speculation and promises about a hardship fund to capture those sectors that have not been able to avail of supports so far. Is that going to come and when will it come?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-18 14:00:00+01:00	Affordable Housing: Motion [Private Members]	1	The housing crisis has hit workers and families in my county of Meath extremely hard. According to the latest Daft.ie rental report, the average rent in Meath is now €1,415, up 4.9% on the figure for this time last year. Rents are 118% higher than they were at their lowest point a few years ago. The monthly rent people are paying is double what a mortgage repayment would be. I am a renter myself. Many younger people are still living with their parents or sharing a house with others to try to keep rent affordable. Families cannot settle in one area because they have to move on when their leases expire. People have no security of tenure. There are thousands on the housing list in Meath and 157 people in the county remain homeless, according to the latest figures. This did not happen by chance. This housing crisis is a direct result of the terrible housing policies pursued by Fine Gael over the past decade and voted through by Fianna Fáil over the years of its disastrous confidence and supply agreement. People are totally locked out of the housing market and have zero confidence that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will fix the problem because they know those parties' policies caused it.  In my county, Meath, the proposal is to dezone hundreds of acres of land. The county has delivered housing. It certainly has not delivered affordable housing but it has delivered housing in recent years. There are proposals to dezone hundreds of acres of land. The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, mentioned that it takes three years to deliver houses from start to finish. On 1 July 2016, the Rebuilding Ireland programme proposed a council housing development on public land at the Coláiste De Lacy site in Ashbourne. Those houses will be delivered in quarter 1 of 2023, seven years later. With the Department of Education working with the local authority, that is how long it takes this Government to deliver on housing. That says everything we need to know about its commitment to delivering public housing on public land. It is not serious about it and will never do it.

These include issues around our state of readiness for this attack, how our systems were or were not in place and the question of whether we should have been more prepared. There is also the issue of resourcing, not just of the NCSC and its facilities, but also the various Departments and agencies that have important work in the cybersecurity area. Does the NCSC have the expertise that is required? What is the working relationship with the various agencies in Ireland, such as the Garda, the Defence Forces, the HSE and other agencies, and also at European and international levels? It seems from responses so far that there is tacit acknowledgement that the NCSC has been severely under-staffed and under-resourced. The fact its budget increased threefold in the last budget essentially acknowledges that the NCSC was severely under-resourced. Will the Minister, Deputy Ryan, respond to that?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	questions	English	2021-05-20 09:00:00+01:00	Questions on Promised Legislation	1	Over 200,000 people are now waiting for a driving theory test or a driving test. This is having a huge impact on people, particularly young people. Driving tests are happening in a limited way. Theory tests are completely closed, more or less, since October. This is despite the fact that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is of the firm opinion that the theory test can be conducted safely during Covid restrictions. Mr. Declan Naughton from the RSA said as much on radio recently. Mr. Naughton stated that if there is a view that the theory test is unsafe for any reason, those in the RSA would love to get to show that with robust anti-Covid measures it is safe. He pointed to the fact that 42,000 driving tests had been conducted since January in even more confined conditions and with no Covid cases. Relating to theory tests, Mr. Naughton stated that the RSA would love the opportunity to demonstrate to public health personnel that it is safe to open. I ask the Minister with responsibility for this area whether a risk assessment has taken place. If not, why not? Most importantly, when will the theory tests reopen?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-20 09:00:00+01:00	Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)	2	I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Murchú, Cronin and Donnelly. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It has been some time coming. Many people are interested in the issue and would have liked to see the Bill being brought forward sooner. Its provisions will be important for those affected, particularly small family farmers and small business owners. It will provide them with some solace and protection and will also ensure, in some part, that their businesses and farms are sustainable and viable. That is a really important point for our rural communities, in particular, and is to be welcomed.  It also speaks to the greater point about models of care and the nursing homes support scheme. There are very significant challenges. Those of us interested in the demographics and the nature of our health services know that we have a very particular challenge in Ireland in sustaining nursing home support and care of the elderly. We all want to see a model that provides for people living at home for as long as possible. That is an important element. Nursing homes have an important role to play, but much needs to be done to ensure that older people can live at home for as long as possible.   Regarding the role of carers and the need to support them to care for people in their homes, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, brought forward a charter for carers. A number of important measures would be of significant benefit in terms of practical supports for carers, such as talk therapy and expanding GP visit cards, in addition to increasing and expanding carer's allowance, carer's benefit and support grants. The introduction of a discretionary grant for carers would be another important measure that would be a significant positive. I know many who are struggling to pay their heating and electricity bills, such is the nature of their work and, unfortunately, the way in which they are valued by this State. It is well recognised that carers play a major role in providing care, which is not valued in the way it should be. That issue needs to be addressed.  The greater point about the role of the nursing homes scheme is that it has developed in a largely uncontrolled way. I see it in my county of Meath, where there was much speculation, general tax breaks and incentives for people to build nursing homes. People have ended up in that sector for reasons other than having a traditional background in healthcare provision and delivery. That, in and of itself, raises the real need for a strong role for HIQA, but also for ensuring maintenance of high standards, which includes the terms and conditions of employment.   The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, certainly in its first wave, many of the weaknesses within the system. We will have an opportunity to address that. Many people working in the sector are dedicated and tremendously hard-working. It would be to everybody's benefit to put in place robust standards and protections for staff, workers and the residents themselves. That will be important going forward as the growing ageing population puts pressure on those services. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and there will be further opportunities to develop it as well.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-25 14:00:00+01:00	International Travel and Aviation: Statements	1	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on international travel. For the first time in almost a year and a half there is light at the end of the tunnel, and that is very welcome. The successful vaccination roll out to date in Ireland, Britain, across Europe and the United States has radically changed the outlook for international travel in a way that we all hoped it would.  As my party's spokesperson on transport and a Deputy representing the constituency of Meath East, I am very familiar with the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector and its workers. I have been in touch with hundreds of those workers individually, and their representatives, over the past 14 months. They have had hours and pay cut and hundreds of jobs have been permanently lost. Pilots demonstrated yesterday and are demonstrating again today. Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications will hear from cabin crew. They are frustrated with the Covid restrictions and fear for their future. They are equally frustrated with the lack of clarity from Government and the lack of a plan and details on the reopening of international travel, and when and how it will happen.   The lack of clarity and planning and always being behind, reacting and on the back foot is a constant feature of the Government's approach to international travel. Since the outset of the pandemic, Sinn Féin's position has been absolutely clear. We called for robust checks and controls at our ports and airports, including pre-departure and post-arrival testing, 100% follow-up and a support package for workers and the industry to protect jobs and strategic connectivity.   Last May, Sinn Féin called for temperature screening at airports, mandatory passenger locator forms, 100% follow-up and an all-Ireland approach. In June, we again called for this and for a traffic light system and international travel based on Covid risk profiles. In July we called for mandatory PCR testing. In September, when representatives from NPHET attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I called for antigen testing to be rolled out as an improvement on the voluntary and expensive PCR testing regime.  The Government did not do any of that. Instead, for the entirety of 2020 there was a complete failure by Government to do anything. Month after month we heard about passenger locator forms follow-up. The figures for this were 6%, 8% and 18%, which was, I understand, the highest rate recorded. It is incredible to think about that. We did not introduce mandatory testing for international travel until we were reporting 8,000 cases a day.  The failure on the part of the Government to implement proper safety checks and protocols at our ports of entry to show that international travel could happen safely led to a total breakdown in public confidence in international travel. With that track record, a Government at sea, public confidence on the floor, 8,000 cases a day and clear public health advice, the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine was an inevitable and necessary measure at a time when we could not move 2 km from home, the vaccine roll-out had barely started and variants of concern were ravaging South Africa, Brazil and the UK.  ICUs were eating into surge capacity. As a temporary measure, a circuit breaker, that is, mandatory hotel quarantine, was necessary. It should have been matched with funding to protect jobs and strategic connectivity. Last week, the Minister and the Minister of State indicated that by the end of June the sector will have received €300 million in supports. At the weekend, that figure became €500 million. Even at that, it does not compare well with other countries. Who bears the brunt? Workers bear the brunt, particularly those who lost their jobs. Customers, who are waiting for refunds and vouchers or who lost money because airlines flew empty planes, also bear the brunt. The Government turned a blind eye to that.  From its lowest ebb, the sector is again looking to the Government. The safe return to international travel will have to be carefully planned and managed. No one wants to risk the gains and huge sacrifices we have made in recent months. It might be expecting too much from a Government that has failed at every turn to put the systems in place and build confidence in them, but there is reason to be hopeful. Vaccines have changed everything and have presented us with opportunities. Data sharing will continue to be essential. The digital Covid-19 certificate will provide an opportunity in this regard. It is a single platform with Covid-19 status, vaccine, antibodies and negative tests. This can enable a safe return to international travel but we still do not know how or when it will be implemented here. There is speculation that there are IT delays. I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to address those concerns and ensure that we are ready. We also need to share data, North and South. There has been considerable Government resistance in this regard.  Testing will continue to be essential. The Minister and the Minister of State need to listen to the Government's chief scientific adviser. Professor Mark Ferguson appeared before the transport committee a few weeks ago and outlined the role antigen testing can play in the safe reopening of international travel. He pointed to international research in Britain, Italy and the United States. PCR testing is prohibitively expensive, is done 72 hours pre-departure and on its own, from a public health perspective, is limited. According to Professor Ferguson, the Government's chief scientific adviser, serial antigen testing, pre-departure and post-arrival in the context of continuing vaccine roll-out, can potentially replace the need for a PCR test and quarantine at home.  The transport committee and, as the Minister of State indicated, the National Civil Aviation Forum have been calling on the Government to pilot this. I ask the Minister of State to see that this happens. The fact that vaccine roll-out is most advanced in Britain, the United States and the EU, the places people from Ireland travel to and from most, offers an opportunity. We have to be continually mindful of public health advice and the patterns of Covid-19 spread. We also have to mindful of the potential pitfalls and, in particular, variants of concern. With the right systems in place, however, we can safely extract ourselves from the current restrictions, including home and hotel quarantine, as we all hoped and always intended.  This Government has always been on the back foot when it comes to international travel. On Friday, the hundreds of thousands of workers in the sector and related sectors will want to see a clear plan on how the systems will work and when they will come into effect. It is the least they deserve.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-27 08:50:00+01:00	Covid-19 Vaccine Roll-out: Statements	1	I raise the vaccine roll-out in County Meath. Everyone wants the roll-out to be a success and I welcome the comments commending those involved in the roll-out. I of course encourage people to take their appointment when they get it. However, in County Meath there is an acknowledged capacity issue at the testing centre in Simonstown. This is in part because County Meath has suffered from years of under-resourcing in public health and primary care, which I know from my time working in the health service and from the regional health forum. Vaccination of the 60-to-69-year-old cohort is not yet finished in the county and in its roll-out there were discrepancies in respect of age and geography; a type of postcode lottery for want of a better phrase. Unfortunately, people voted with their feet in some cases and went directly on spec to the Helix. Now for the 50-to-59-year-old age cohort, people on the County Dublin border, in Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin and Dunboyne are receiving appointments not at the Helix, nor Citywest or Simonstown, but in Mullingar. I fear what this will mean for uptake and confidence in the roll-out. All the staff are doing their very best but there is an acknowledged capacity issue. I heard my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, raise the same issue yesterday in respect of the neighbouring area of Dublin 15. These capacity constraints are acknowledged by the HSE. Is the Minister aware of them? Bearing in mind we are not yet into the younger, larger age cohorts in County Meath, can he confirm whether there are plans for a second vaccination centre in the county? He mentioned UCD but nowhere in County Meath. Fairyhouse, for example, might be a good location. If there are such plans, when will that vaccination centre open?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	questions	English	2021-05-27 08:50:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	1	Workers at the Smurfit Kappa newspaper printing press in Kells, County Meath, learned a couple of weeks ago that, subject to regulatory approval by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, the operation in Kells is to be acquired by KIP Limited, an indirect UK incorporated subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp UK. Workers there are deeply concerned that their terms and conditions of employment, including redundancy entitlements, will be hollowed out in the process. Many of the workers have decades of loyal service to Smurfit, which is a successful and profitable company. Is the Tánaiste aware of this proposed acquisition? Does he have an opinion on it? What assurance can he offer as Tánaiste that the terms and conditions of employment, including redundancy entitlements, will be protected?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-27 08:50:00+01:00	Health (Amendment) Act 2021: Motion	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I echo Deputy Cullinane's comments. Mandatory hotel quarantine was a very significant and important public health intervention. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, nor should it have been. It was, and is, controversial but as outlined, it was a significant tool in response to the risk of importation of the virus. In many respects, it was an inevitability given the many failures by the Government to get ahead of things, to address and put in place systems that would minimise the risk of the importation of the virus and would give people confidence that the limited amount of international travel that was permitted was happening safely. I point specifically to issues such as the introduction of the passenger locator form, on a voluntary basis initially, but which the Government was forced to make mandatory, in respect of which the follow-up was pathetic throughout. That undermined public confidence. The same applies in regard to testing. It is incredible that we did not introduce mandatory testing until there were in the region of 8,000 cases per day. That was reckless. At that stage, mandatory hotel quarantine became an absolute necessity, if it had not been previously. As has been outlined, it has played an important role. It was only ever envisaged to be a temporary measure. The circumstances today are very different from what they were in January, February and March, when it was being introduced. Had the necessary preparations been made in advance, I do not believe we would have had the initial issues in terms of the anomalies, contradictions and difficult and hard cases that presented, many of which were resolved in a sensible and common-sense way.   The significant vaccine roll-out in Ireland, the United States, across the European Union and in Britain, in particular, presents a major opportunity for the future with regard to reopening international travel but it has to be done carefully. There are risks in terms of variants of concern. I agree with Deputy Cullinane's analysis on how we should work forward in a phased way to relax these restrictions. The priority needs to be the roll-out of the digital green certificate. We need to be in a position to adopt it as early as possible and, in that regard, to prioritise the common travel area, the European Union and the United States. There is need for an explicit indication of what criteria will apply. Obviously, variants of concern are just that, that is, variants of concern, but the risk factor changes as we get more people vaccinated and the information is generated. We need clarity and transparency in order that people are aware of the criteria that apply. I know that is a frustration for people. Hopefully, we do not have to live with the constraints of mandatory hotel quarantine for a lot longer.  I want to emphasise a point that has been made in terms of our Covid restrictions around international travel, that is, the opportunity of antigen testing. My own background is in diagnostics. I worked in that area for 15 years. At different times and for different reasons, we have argued that a single point in time PCR test is of limited use. We have argued for post-arrival testing. Professor Mark Ferguson outlines the opportunity that exists to improve on that protection with serial antigen testing. In doing that, we can potentially reduce the cost of the overall testing, reduce the cost of international travel and improve on the system we have in place in terms of providing protections for people. It might also present an opportunity in terms of the issue of quarantine at home and mandatory hotel quarantine. We should be innovative and progressive and test these systems and be ahead of the game in relation to them.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-15 14:00:00+01:00	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	1	I want to raise the crisis facing our aviation sector. The collapse of Stobart Air last weekend came as another major blow for the sector and for our regional economies. The announcement followed the recent Aer Lingus base closures in Cork and Shannon. After 15 very difficult months, hundreds of workers have been made redundant. It is now reported that Nordica, the Estonian state-owned airline, may take over the Kerry-Dublin route. This is welcome, as any future re-establishment of public service obligation, PSO, routes would be.  However, it begs the question as to why more was not done to protect Irish jobs, which could now be outsourced. Why was more not done to protect connectivity? Connectivity and regional economies are at risk and jobs are lost. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan's hands-off approach is seriously damaging Irish aviation. We need a survival and recovery plan now. What action will this Government take to help the aviation sector and secure the future of our regional airports?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-15 14:00:00+01:00	Pyrite and Mica Redress Issues: Motion [Private Members]	1	I too commend Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Doherty for bringing forward this motion. It is timely and very important. I extend my solidarity to the people of County Donegal who came in such great numbers today and commend them for everything they have gone through to fight their corner.  It is clear the scheme in place is not fit for purpose. Deputy O'Reilly referenced how the experience of building, creating and investing in one's own home, full of hope and plans for the future, only to see that literally crumble around one is devastating. I do not know any of the people involved but I can see from the footage, and from speaking to people today, what it means to them. I know about the experience of living with pyrite from my own constituents in Meath East, particularly in areas like Ashbourne, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin. They fought their own battle, took it to the High Court, failed there and went the political route so a scheme would be put in place for them. I am sure every one of them would say it must be a 100% scheme. The scheme must be fit for purpose. It is no addition if people cannot get on the first step of the ladder to it, if they cannot get access to it. I draw the comparison as well between the cost of the initial test, as it appears to be in County Donegal, versus the visual test for the pyrite scheme. The damage that is done is quite obvious.  To follow up on Deputy O'Reilly's points, there are a number of issues still outstanding with the pyrite scheme. From dealing with people in my own constituency, there are issues with estates where pyrite is only now becoming apparent after the deadline of December 2013. I know of one particular case where a lady encouraged her mother to buy the house next door for practical reasons, only for it to have pyrite and for them to have to appeal, and to go into the process is a difficulty. There is an issue with the caps on the rent, and the scheme in County Donegal must include that element of supporting the rent, but there is also a pressure to move out after the money is used. The concerns I am hearing from people on that is that they must almost take it or leave it, as far as the quality of the work done is concerned; they have no recourse in relation to it and find themselves in a difficult position.  There are, therefore, a number of elements that must be resolved with the pyrite scheme and I encourage the Minister to look at them. Deputy O'Reilly and others addressed the specific root cause of mica and pyrite all across the country. That is still there and must be addressed. I commend the motion and again thank the Deputies for bringing it forward.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-16 09:10:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages	1	I move amendment No. 1: In page 5, line 8, to delete “the transition” and substitute “a just transition”. I am disappointed to see reflected in the Bill that the Government has taken nothing on board from the 12 hours of Committee Stage scrutiny we had on this Bill last week. Some 231 amendments from Opposition politicians were put forward and not only did the Minister refuse to accept any of them, he also failed to bring forward any of his own based on what was said at the lengthy Committee Stage hearings. We highlighted a plethora of areas that need to be addressed in this Bill and Sinn Féin brought forward amendments in a number of these areas, including on: the definition of a just transition and climate justice; the process of appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council; the investor-state dispute mechanisms and their potential impact on climate action, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA; addressing the anomaly of the Government not being considered a relevant body; fracking; the need for impact assessments for specific areas; and democratic oversight of climate action plans. Some of those amendments were ruled out of order and none of them was accepted. That is a very disappointing approach that undermines the cross-party approach that should have been taken to such major legislation, which will set out a framework for the next 30 years. We have resubmitted a number of amendments on Report Stage and I urge the Minister to improve the aspects of the Bill that we have identified.  One major area of concern is around the just transition aspect of the Bill, or the lack thereof, and that concern is reflected in amendment No. 1. We absolutely recognise the urgent need to combat climate change but we also want to ensure that decisions taken now and into the future do not disproportionately affect those who can least afford it. Although this Bill will not detail the policy decisions to be taken, it will outline the considerations that must be taken into account when proposing specific actions. We want to make sure the decisions taken to meet the ambitious targets contained in this Bill are progressive and fair, and have local communities at their core. Our amendments, specifically those dealing with just transition and climate justice, seek to achieve that. It is vital that this principle is enshrined in the legislation. This is where successive Governments have failed time and again. They have left people behind. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have opted all too comfortably for punitive measures which hurt the most vulnerable in our society. As a result, for the vast majority of ordinary families, climate action is associated with cost. The climate Bill must not be blind to the concerns of local communities. If we are to successfully move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a carbon neutral economy, we need a plan that brings communities with us, not one that penalises them or forgets about them altogether.  Sinn Féin’s amendments Nos. 1, 22 and 23 all refer to the need for the inclusion of a definition of a just transition and just transition principles.  'just transition principles’ means the importance of taking action to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases in a way which— (a) supports environmentally and socially sustainable jobs, (b) supports low-carbon investment and infrastructure, (c) develops and maintains social consensus through engagement with workers, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organisations, representatives of the interests of business and industry and such other persons as the Ministers consider appropriate, (d) creates decent, fair, and high-value work in a way which does not negatively affect the current workforce and overall economy, (e) contributes to resource efficient and sustainable economic approaches which help to address inequality and poverty.  Our later amendments

We are discussing amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 19 to 23, inclusive. Many Members who went to the bother of tabling amendments have not yet had the opportunity to speak to them, although they are speaking to other amendments on other important matters. I thought if we could move from this group of amendments, we could move to amendment No. 2 and some Deputies could speak to their own amendments rather than those of other people.  It is really important we have an opportunity to vote on the question of a just transition. It should be at the very heart of this Bill.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	questions	English	2021-06-17 09:00:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	1	A number of weeks ago, I raised the proposed acquisition of Smurfit Kappa News Press in Kells by KIP Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of News Corp. The matter is currently with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. At that stage, I told the Tánaiste there were concerns the terms and conditions of employment and redundancy would be under threat and he said he would ask his officials to contact the company. Now, regrettably, those concerns have been heightened and it is feared the company will close immediately after a transfer, at least for a period, and that those terms will be reduced. Have the Tánaiste's officials contacted Smurfit Kappa and News Corp? What assurances can the Tánaiste provide workers that they are not going to be the victim of a company offloading its redundancy responsibilities, particularly as commitments in respect of those responsibilities were hard-won in negotiations?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-17 09:00:00+01:00	Regional Airports and Aviation: Statements	1	I welcome the fact that the House has made time for statements on international travel but it is more than statements that we need. We have had statements on the matter on several occasions, not least in recent weeks. There are many people interested in this sector. More than 140,000 people across the State are dependent on it, directly or indirectly, and to a man and to a woman they are very anxious for the Government to outline and present a plan and, in the meantime, for it to provide supports for the sector and the workers in it.  There have been many criticisms made of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as a result of his hands-off approach. I am disappointed that he is not available today to address this really important issue. I note that there is a proposal for another task force in respect of Shannon, for example. There is almost a pattern in terms of the response. It is important to note that although 19 July is in our sights, everything will not just fall back into place when travel reopens on that date. In fact, airports, airlines and aviation workers will face a significant uphill challenge in the coming months as travel resumes and they will need continuing support.  The transport committee has spent recent days discussing in detail the merits of antigen testing. I raised the issue again with the Minister this morning on Oral Questions. It is clear there was an attempt by some members of Government parties to lay the blame for all this at the feet of NPHET but the evidence of the CMO to the transport committee yesterday highlighted that the Department of Transport simply has not pursued this avenue aggressively. The CMO clearly stated yesterday to the committee that there is no evidence base for introducing antigen testing for international travel. I and other members of the committee pointed to several reports but none of the reports dealt with the area of international travel specifically. We can argue the merits of taking lessons from one report and trying one's best to implement a scheme but what I heard clearly was that no pilot studies were pursued. I do not think it is sufficient for the Department or the Ministers to have raised the prospect of antigen testing only to be told it is not advised or it is advised against. The whole point was to generate in a risk-free way a pilot study within the current constraints to assess the effectiveness or usefulness of antigen testing. If that were done, then at least we would know whether it would be effective rather than having to speculate in that regard and we could generate our own evidence base. To say that the issue was raised in the middle of May but the Department was told the advice was different is not satisfactory. In fact, an aggressive approach could have been taken far earlier.  It is quite likely that antigen testing would not be the be all and end all. All Members recognise that Covid is a real challenge and that we have to follow the public health advice at all times, but what is at stake here is that the Government is being asked to try to strike the best balance. It may be the case that no better balance can be found than the one with which we had to live, but the argument is that there were opportunities to do more but they were not taken.  On a related point, I discussed previously with the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and heard discussed this morning the prohibitive cost of PCR testing, particularly for children who may be travelling with parents after 19 July. There is a question mark regarding how that will be dealt with. This morning the Minister, Deputy Ryan, stated that it will be considered. We should also consider the possibility of antigen testing. There is a real argument to be made in terms of the most cost-efficient way to do things in the context of the taxpayer, but we must also be mindful of the public health advice in this regard. That said, there is still merit to pursuing pilot antigen tests.  As regards the digital Covid certificate, DCC, I hope the Ministers can provide more clarity regarding the introduction of the DCC, how it will work here and what criteria will apply. Many people will want to know that information as quickly as possible. It is to be hoped that a large number of people will be vaccinated in the near future. What role will PCR testing play? What criteria will apply in respect of various countries, particularly for those coming back into Ireland? Will there be a role for antigen testing? Many people are keenly interested in that issue. There is a host of questions to be asked. When will people be able to apply for the certificate? How long will it take to process? How will it work for those arriving in Ireland? Will the system work with those of non-EU countries such as the USA and Canada? There is still a lack of detail around this critical tool for safe international travel. I encourage the Minister and the Government to provide as much information as possible as early as possible on this issue.  What is the status of the aviation recovery task force report with which we have lived since last July? It was prepared and published last summer but few of its recommendations have been implemented. Why have the recommendations not been implemented? Will recommendation No. 5, which relates to the rebate of airport and air navigation charges relating to Dublin Airport, be introduced? On recommendation No. 6, which proposes a common fixed sum per passenger for Cork, Shannon, Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal airports, is there a plan for such a scheme to be introduced for these airports or has the Government combined these recommendations in the €26 million package approved by the European Commission earlier this year? If that is the case, I fear the Government has greatly underestimated the scale of support needed by the sector. I ask that clarity be provided regarding the exact source and scale of funding for the sector.  I refer to a group of workers in an industry directly related to the travel industry, namely, travel agents. Theirs was one of the first industries to close and will likely be one of the last to reopen fully. Travel agents feel they have been overlooked in most recent Covid support announcements, notwithstanding the ongoing assistance provided under the employment wage subsidy scheme, which will begin to be phased out from September. Taking travel agents off the Covid restrictions support scheme now will result in the cliff edge the Government promised to avoid. The business resumption support scheme is capped at three weeks but the lack of revenue for the industry will continue for at least six months. I ask the Minister of State to address this massive issue facing travel agents.  I will conclude by referring to Stobart Air. My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, and I met worker representatives from the airline this morning. Having worked for years for the company, they were devastated by what has happened. The way they were informed of the liquidation, in the middle of the night, was completely unfair. They have been left in an information vacuum. The liquidators contacted them in the past 24 hours and they were given a frequently asked questions document. That is the height of it. They have really important questions to ask about redundancy and social welfare entitlements. Some people, in pursuit of work with the company, moved from being based in Dublin to being based in Belfast, as a result of which there is a question mark over their social welfare entitlements. Will the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, engage with this group of workers and help them in every way they can? They have had a really tough 15 months and the way they have been treated in recent days is completely unacceptable. They need every support that is available.

The preparation of development plans are important and shape the development of a county for the life of the plan. At their heart has to be the principal of participation and a commitment by local and central government that the vision set out in the written statements and maps comes to fruition. Meath County Council's plan is at an advanced stage. Today is the deadline for submissions on the material amendments. The final amended plan is expected to be completed in October or November of this year. In many respects, Meath County Council has been a guinea pig in all of this. From the council's perspective, officials have worked very hard to work through the review of the plan in the midst of Covid. They have been innovative. New online portals have been successfully developed, for example, and meetings have happened in person, online and in hybrid formats.  It has not been without issue. There are ongoing legal issues regarding access to taped recordings of the meetings. That would not happen ordinarily, but because of the new Covid restricted format we have them. How that information should be used is a bone of some considerable contention. Is it an official record of the meeting and its interactions and votes, etc., or is it an aid for preparing the official minutes?  More fundamentally, in Meath there is a question of the impact of the plan on the future social and economic development of the county. I refer in particular to the issue of dezoning. A couple of weeks ago, the   At the root of the county development plan is the ambition of local people, through their representatives, to deliver the best for their communities. They do not ask for much. Communities like Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin, Dunboyne, Stamullen and many others in my constituency of Meath East have lived through and with the consequences of the Celtic tiger, including developer-led rampant development, with light or no touch regulation. Houses have been built, but when it came to community infrastructure, including community centres, créches, playgrounds, public green spaces and parks it could not and cannot be done. In Ashbourne, the community is united in its call for a public park of regional scale. Before the deadline this afternoon, close to 2,500 submissions in support of a proposal to zone lands for an 80-acre park will have been submitted. That is incredible. I want to commend everyone from the community and across the political spectrum who had a role in getting us to this point. I want to commend, in particular, the Ashbourne Playspace Network and, more recently, the Ashbourne Public Greenspaces Community Group for their tireless work over many years.  The community in Ashbourne is a perfect example of a community that is organised and playing its part. Members of the community engaged, lobbied, argued, petitioned, fundraised, protested and campaigned. Men and women – mostly women - have fought for the best for their community and children. It is not much that they ask for - a playground, public park and safe place to bring their children, go for a walk or run, play or kick a ball. It is incredible that they have to do that at all. At every turn, they meet resistance. The council is either reluctant or dealing with its own funding and other constraints. The Government, be it led by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, has added nothing. Communities are doing all the right things but are being failed. This needs to change now.  I invite the Minister to Ashbourne. He has a role to play, as does his Department. He should meet the local councillors and community groups. The county development plan and zoning issues will run their course. Regardless of their outcome, though, the community wants and deserves a public park. I implore the Minister and his Department to work with Meath County Council to make that happen. A meeting with stakeholders would be a help. The Minister has been to Ashbourne and I have met him there many times. There is an opportunity now. There is considerable popular support for this proposal across the political divide. It can happen and I would welcome the Minister's support in making it happen.

Ireland is the only country that was not in compliance with the regulations. We have missed this deadline, although it was not a deadline for us. There are many who are concerned we will miss the deadline of 19 July. We are told we will be emailed our vaccine record but nobody submitted their email address when they applied for the vaccine and there is concern in that regard. Can the Tánaiste guarantee that the system will be live and operational by 19 July? In terms of the potential for an expanded role for a certificate, will antigen testing be incorporated in the system if it is used domestically, but also in terms of international travel?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-07-07 09:10:00+01:00	Post Office Network: Motion [Private Members]	1	I move amendment No. 1: “notes the findings and recommendations contained in the Grant Thornton report entitled ‘Review of the economic contribution and financial sustainability of the Irish Post Office Network’, commissioned by the Irish Postmasters' Union, which recognises the contribution of the post office network, the huge challenges facing the sector and includes a recommendation to introduce a Public Service Obligation (PSO) of approximately €17 million per annum; and”; and “— implement proposals contained in the Final Report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group (Kerr Report) published in 2016; and — introduce a PSO to guarantee the current post office network and help prevent further closures, to ensure people have continued access to the important services post offices provide.” I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and thank the Regional Group for tabling it. Sinn Féin has always been vocal in its support for protecting our post office network. Post offices are crucial services in our towns and villages and are especially important in rural Ireland, where they provide essential services and serve as a meeting point for local people. Therefore, we fully support this motion and have also tabled an amendment highlighting the requirement for a PSO to be introduced. A number of the motion's sponsors made reference to that as well. This is not a new idea. Indeed, the need for a PSO has been spoken about for years. One of the central recommendations of the Grant Thornton report was the introduction of a PSO to secure the future of the network and allow post offices to continue providing their excellent and important services. Some €17 million per annum was suggested as an appropriate amount. While I welcome the €8.5 million that has been agreed between the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, and An Post, it is half the amount deemed necessary in the Grant Thornton report and is intended to cover a protracted period. I am concerned that it is not enough and I am also concerned, having heard from the Minister of State, about the Government's commitment to directly intervene and provide State funding to support the network.  When Sinn Féin tabled a motion on the future of post offices in the previous Dáil, Fianna Fáil submitted an amendment calling for a PSO to be introduced. Now, more than a year into a Fianna Fáil-led Government, it still has not introduced one and we are still waiting and kicking the can down the road to a questionable future for the security of the network. Postmasters are frustrated from hearing Government representatives talking about the benefits and importance of our post office system but doing little to support it. This frustration is justified. We were here in October debating this very issue and the Government has done little since. The Government needs to stop prevaricating on this issue and introduce a PSO. I hope other Deputies will support our amendment. It will send a clear message that we need more than warm words from the Government; we need real action now. The Grant Thornton report also set out the challenges faced by the post office network and highlighted the significant value and contribution it makes to our economy and society. It showed that the estimated social value of the network stands between €334 million and €776 million per annum.  However, the real value of the helpful and friendly service, the local knowledge and the convenience of post offices is immeasurable, particularly for older people. In government, Sinn Féin will not just provide a PSO to shore up our network but will work with An Post, postmasters and unions to bolster the services post offices can offer and secure the future of the service. There is a list of State services that should be considered for provision through the post office network. This could include motor tax, the public services card, payment of fines, payment of tax, property registration documents, voter registration, the certification of official documentation and the registration of births, deaths and marriages. We are not suggesting removing these services from existing offices or agencies but post offices could provide another avenue for people to access to more State services, on a more local basis.  An Post’s green hub is a great recent addition in that regard. To meet our climate targets, we will need to transition to cleaner heating and transport options and the post office can act as a one-stop shop for people accessing information and grants in this area. It can be daunting for people when trying to find information about retrofitting, solar panels and the grants that are available, or might be in the future, and having a trusted local post office providing this information will be invaluable.  I know very well from my constituency the impact the loss of a post office can have on a community. My local post office in Tara was one of the more than 100 post offices closed in 2018. Local people, particularly older people, say to me that it has not been the same since the closure of that post office. The outpouring of goodwill and support for the post office network has been positive. I encourage the Minister of State to support the motion and the Sinn Féin amendment and to address the needs of the post office network to put it on a secure and sound footing into the future.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-07-14 09:15:00+01:00	Mandatory Hotel Quarantine Extension: Motion	1	We are disappointed and frustrated with how the motion has been proposed. The way the Government has been handling wide-reaching emergency legislation in recent weeks, via motions and guillotined debates, shows contempt for the Opposition. No Opposition briefing has been provided in advance of the motion to inform us of the up-to-date epidemiological circumstances in countries on the designated state list, yet we are expected to vote in favour of it, which would again extend the broad powers contained in the Health (Amendment) Act 2021 to people arriving from 61 countries throughout the world. These are significant matters but that is not reflected in this one-line motion and this is not the way to do business.  The introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine during the height of the crisis here was the correct decision. It has left us in a stronger position to move ahead with the reopening of travel from next week and, as the Minister of State outlined, it played an important role at a time when we were in the early stages of the vaccine roll-out and even before that - with the risk of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants - when it contributed significantly to protecting the vaccine roll-out. We support mandatory hotel quarantine going forward and believe there is a place for it in certain circumstances during the ongoing pandemic, as many countries are going to continue to face considerable challenges, whether that is rampant spread or new variants. As I said, however, these powers are very far reaching, and expecting us to rubber-stamp a motion such as this, with little to no debate, is simply not appropriate.  It seems many of the issues with the current system have not yet been addressed. People who have been fully vaccinated with WHO-approved, but not EMA-approved, vaccines are still required to go into mandatory hotel quarantine and this is a source of frustration for people. I ask the Minister of State to continue with efforts to resolve this, presumably by working with European counterparts and colleagues. People who have to travel for medical issues that do not fall under the current exemptions are still not provided for, resulting in numerous problems and confusion in this area. The lack of clarity over how countries are designated or removed from the list remains vague, something on which we have called for increased transparency.  As our office, like others I am sure, has been inundated with complaints about issues with the system, I welcome that a survey on user satisfaction is to be commenced among people who are or have been in mandatory hotel quarantine. It would be appropriate and useful if there were a dedicated point of contact for representatives because many queries arise from time to time. Moreover, the information provided online about the rules and exemptions needs to be improved. That will be an increasingly important feature as we move past 19 July. I accept that the Department of Foreign Affairs web page and   As I said, we would have liked the opportunity to contribute more significantly to this as a policy. For the Government to take as a given that we would support every measure at the outset and rubber-stamp them at every opportunity when it brings them to the House is not good enough. We need a proper debate on these issues. We could have had that, with opportunity for input from the Opposition, but we have been curtailed, as we have been this morning. That is a source of frustration for all of us in the Opposition.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-07-14 09:15:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: From the Seanad	2	It relates to climate justice. We had a long discussion and debate on climate justice during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Committee Stage. There was progress and then we hit a wall in regard to it. It seems like there has been a sprint in recent days given the level and number of changes. It is very frustrating for those of us in the Opposition who have spent time on the Bill, who have listened and learned during the process. We have tried to contribute in a constructive way. It is difficult to comprehend what is happening with the Bill in the Government and the Department.  I support the amendment on climate justice. I know we have debated this high up and down low on Committee Stage and there was no movement on it. I think there is agreement that we should withdraw the climate justice definition on the basis that it is better to have no definition than the one contained in the Bill. I would argue that we are better with the definition that has been proposed by Deputy Bríd Smith. It is a significant improvement on the definition the Minister introduced, and I would encourage his support for it.  The just transition has been consistently raised. It is now included in the Title of the Bill. That is a very half-hearted effort because, as the Minister well knows, there were proposals at various stages to include a just transition definition and just transition principles throughout the Bill to strengthen it and they have not been accepted. People will see through what is happening in that regard.  An important point to raise at this juncture is what has happened between the discussions in the Seanad and now on the amendments introduced by the Minister. It is very clear that there is deep concern at the very least. The Minister will acknowledge himself that the fact that he has to introduce amendments to his own Bill indicates it is a long way short of good practice in the legislative process. I urge the Minister to heed the criticisms of these amendments and to withdraw them. He will have the opportunity between now and Friday to consider this matter again. There is deep concern about the amendments' implication. I am not satisfied that they are robust and sound, given how they have been developed and proposed in just a handful of days. I echo the call from others regarding the Minister's approach of introducing these amendments, which could have profound implications, at the eleventh hour.

They have heard directly from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, that the PUP will be extended until February 2022 and that self-employed people will continue to be able to earn €960 after expenses over an eight-week period while retaining their full PUP entitlement. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is telling them that a phased reduction will start on 7 September and as PUP recipients go onto the €203 rate in each phase, they will be transferred to standard jobseeker's terms. Many taxi drivers are already on the €203 rate, some of them because they invested in new cars in the weeks and months before Covid hit, for which they are suffering as a consequence. Others will move onto the €203 rate in the coming phases. They are not jobseekers. They are worried and concerned. Will the Tánaiste spell out how they will be treated in the weeks ahead? Will they stay on the PUP?

What role will the Tánaiste and the Government play in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines? I am aware of, and support, the call for a TRIPS waiver. Does the Tánaiste support that call? If so, that is great; if not, how will Ireland and the EU play a leading role in that regard? I do not believe that answer is in tokenism or patronage. How will Ireland and the EU play a leading role to ensure a fair and equitable roll-out?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-09-29 09:12:00+01:00	Data Centre Moratorium: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Deputy Whitmore and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this timely and necessary motion. What we have unfolding before us, particularly in recent months, is a picture of abject failure on behalf of successive Governments to prepare and manage energy and electricity policy, and supply and demand, adequately. Amber alerts are now a common feature, electricity outages are increasingly common and avoiding blackouts cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, this Government will bend over backwards to facilitate the entry of energy-sapping data centres into the market. As we now have about 70 of them, we think it is a good idea to get the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to have a look at their impact – now, not before we started granting permissions.  It is not as if the Minister has not been warned. My party has for years warned about this high-wire act. In our Powering Ireland 2030 document, published in 2018, we pointed to the need to manage demand, to curtail the expansion of data centres and to take control. These warnings, and the warnings from EirGrid and the CRU, appear to be falling on deaf ears in Government Buildings, so I think it is right that the Dáil now calls for an emergency brake on the future development of data centres.  We appreciate the need for data centres. They provide a vital service that keeps many of the digital aspects of our lives running but it is clear the uncontrolled and ill-conceived Government policy, which has encouraged the rampant expansion of data centres here, is now threatening the electricity supply to Irish households and businesses, which is simply unacceptable.  The last Fine Gael Government set a target of making Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with absolutely no thought about the impact this would have on our carbon emissions or on electricity supply. The current Government has not changed approach. On the one hand, it rolls out the red carpet for data centres while, on the other, it postpones renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions, it dithers with the roll-out of offshore wind - just listen to Wind Energy Ireland - and it dithers with microgeneration, which is always just around the corner but still not here.  EirGrid and the CRU have warned that rolling blackouts are possible if action is not taken on the unprecedented growth of electricity demand from data centres. The Minister added to these concerns on the national airwaves this morning. Make no mistake about it: this crisis, and it is a crisis, is a direct result of incoherent Government policies pursued by Fine Gael in recent years and continued by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  In the last four years, data centre demand has grown by 2,400 GW hours, the equivalent of 560,000 homes. If allowed to continue, current and planned data centres could consume anywhere between 25% and 70% of peak electricity demand by 2030. This simply is not feasible or sustainable. It is reckless and dangerous. Based on the track record of the three Government parties, it risks the lights going out and widespread social unrest, not to mention the irreparable damage it will do to the climate and the climate movement. The growth of data centres is already jeopardising the State’s 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51%, a commitment that is less than three months old. Research carried out by   In the meantime, we roll out the red carpet. Data centres benefit from our PSO, among other things. They do not pay their fair share. PSO is levied at peak demand but, of course, data centres have a gigantic but steady demand so they do better, while little old women in my constituency are forced to do their washing in the middle of the night to save a few cent. Then, there are the tax reliefs that this Government knows nothing about. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party: it is almost like hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, highlighted that the Minister for Finance does not know the total value of tax reliefs that have been gifted to companies through capital allowances claimed against their data centre investment. The Minister for Finance does not know. It is literally unbelievable. From listening to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today, it sounds like he does not know either. At the root of this motion, in my opinion, is an absolute lack of confidence that this Government has this real energy challenge in hand or that it is in control. I share that concern. I look at the Government amendment, I hear the Minister on the national airwaves, I hear him speak this morning, and I am not inspired. In fact, it is the opposite. Deputy Ryan is the Minister responsible. This is the Government responsible, but it points to EirGrid and the CRU, stating that management of the impact of electricity demand on the grid is more appropriately dealt with through regulatory measures in the electricity sector. That is not good enough. Make no mistake about it: if the lights go out, the Minister and the Government will be the ones held accountable.  The threat now posed to the electricity system will not just have negative consequences for households and businesses; it will also have a massively damaging effect on Ireland’s international reputation. The prospect of the CRU’s final direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks, as the Minister points out in his amendment, is not enough. The truth is that it is an absolute indictment of the Government that we have ever got to this point, in 2021, in Ireland. The Government would do well to heed the warnings and act without delay.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	questions	English	2021-09-29 09:12:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Reachtaíocht a Gealladh - Questions on Promised Legislation	1	It is significant that no Minister, including the Taoiseach, can assure the people that we will not have blackouts during the winter. That is significant and a clear case of mismanagement. The red carpet is rolled out on the demand side and the Government dithers on the supply side. Renewable energy support scheme, RESS, auctions have been postponed. Wind Energy Ireland maintains that offshore projects under the watch of this Government have been delayed due to the lack of a framework and the microgeneration scheme continues to be promised mañana. I ask the Taoiseach to expedite the implementation of the offshore wind legislation. Those in the sector maintain that because there is no framework, projects are being delayed. When will the microgeneration scheme be introduced? We have not seen that legislation.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-09-30 09:00:00+01:00	Climate Action: Statements	1	The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, reports leave us in no doubt about the twin climate and biodiversity crises we face and that we will have even more devastating consequences if urgent action is not taken now. Unfortunately, successive governments have failed to do enough in this area and, as a result, they have left us with a mountain to climb. While it will be a challenge to meet our carbon reduction targets, not doing enough now will result in a much higher environmental, social and financial cost in the future. With this in mind, this week has been extraordinary. Hearing a Green Party Minister go to bat for energy-sapping data centres and admit we will to have to keep power plants burning coal and oil for longer to avert blackouts due to the massive demand from those very data centres is a sorry state of affairs, to say the least.  Sinn Féin supports a moratorium on data centres. In our Powering Ireland 2030 document, published more than three years ago, we pointed to the need to manage demand and curtail the expansion of data centres. We highlighted data centres benefit from the current public service obligation, PSO, construct which is levied at peak demand but, of course, data centres have a gigantic but steady demand and so do better. We also highlighted data centres should be contributing to the development of wind power and grid upgrades here.  We have no data on whether these companies are building their own wind farms to power the data centres or just buying up wind farms that are built or are being built here. If a wind farm is built here, the intention is the energy from it will replace the fossil fuel electricity homes are currently using. If, however, a data centre company comes in and buys up this wind farm to power itself solely, the houses for which that energy was intended will still be using electricity produced by fossil fuel power plants, thereby making our net national decarbonisation challenge even more difficult. This relates to the question of the net impact and the net effect.   Further to this, upgrades are needed for our electricity grid. This investment is needed to accommodate the electrification of our heating systems and cars, but also to manage our demand and supply. EirGrid, which is the semi-State company charged with this task, has failed in its duty to engage with communities to progress important grid works. It has failed to deliver necessary grid improvements. This has happened in communities that accept the need for grid improvements. I am thinking about the North-South interconnector, for example. These are communities that have shown a willingness to accept controversial infrastructure. We think of the tailings pond at Tara Mines in Baile Ghib, the County Meath Gaeltacht. The community accepts living with that infrastructure. EirGrid has taken an entirely different approach. It has sought to walk on communities. By doing that, it has managed to mobilise an entire region against necessary infrastructure. Based on the approach of rolling out the red carpet to international companies, I wonder what would happen if Facebook, Amazon, or Intel knocked on the door of EirGrid and said that they needed the North-South interconnector. I believe it surely would happen. That, for me is a real contrast.  I believe offshore wind will play a massive role in our climate ambitions. Again, I am concerned about the speed of progress in this area. Wind Energy Ireland published its first report earlier this month. It reported 12 months to deliver offshore wind energy. It identified seven urgent actions that the industry says need to be delivered by this time next year if 5,000 MW of wind energy is to be delivered in the coming years. These include fixing the foreshore licence system; providing more resources for relevant agencies; a timeline for renewable energy support scheme, RESS, auctions; progressing the maritime area planning Bill; establishing an offshore grid steering committee; strengthening our electricity grid; and developing our ports to ensure offshore can be built from our island.  There is a lot of work to be done in this area if we are to deliver 5,000 MW of offshore wind to transform our energy system. Wind Energy Ireland says that current projects are being delayed because the framework is not in place. It says that the 2030 targets are in danger of being missed because the framework is not in place. Some of that is on this Government. A lot of it is on previous governments. All of it points to years of inaction.  Sinn Féin has acknowledged the role of private companies in developing offshore, but we also want to see semi-States, such as the ESB and Bord na Móna, invest, develop and, importantly, retain ownership of renewable energy projects. It is essential that the State does not become as reliant on private renewable energy production as it has become on private fossil fuel energy production. The constant energy price hikes demonstrate how dependent and exposed the State is to volatility in the international energy markets and highlight the need to eliminate this threat going forward.   Microgeneration is another area in which the Government is slow and falling behind. Again, previous governments had lots of rhetoric, but took no action. This Government has lots of rhetoric and has taken some action, but it is still behind time and failing to deliver. It has been four years since Sinn Féin and Deputy Brian Stanley introduced our microgeneration support scheme Bill in the Dáil. Our Bill would have allowed households, community groups, farmers and businesses to make a significant contribution towards renewable energy production here, as well as to be rewarded for the excess energy that they produce. Four years later, we still have no Government scheme and the Government has missed its own summer 2021 target. On a regular basis, people who are early adopters contact me wondering where this Bill is. It is frustrating for those who invested early, as they were encouraged to do, but are not being compensated for the excess renewable electricity they contribute to the grid each day. We raised this as a priority question last week. I raised it with the Taoiseach yesterday. I ask the Minister when we will see that Bill.  Good quality public transport options will be key in the transport transition. Lower fares, increased capacity and new infrastructure all fall into this. We are all concerned to hear of the potential delays to important public transport projects, such as MetroLink and DART+. This is hugely disappointing news for those living on the proposed routes. It flies in the face of the rhetoric of getting people out of cars and into public transport. It raises the question: if these so-called priority projects are to be delayed beyond 2030, what will that mean for our targets? What will it mean for the type of transition we will be able to achieve before that date?  On electric vehicles, EVs, I welcome the provisional numbers from the Minister yesterday at the select committee showing that EVs now account for 15% of new registrations. Sales are up 226% year-on-year. However, we have a huge way to go to reach the EV target of 1 million vehicles by 2030. To reach this, we need to look at the EV grant scheme again. Analysis from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggests that subsidising 100,000 EVs using 2019 levels of support would cost the Exchequer between €965 million and €1.23 billion. That is an enormous amount of taxpayers’ money. It is therefore essential that this funding is targeted at those who need it. We neither want a situation where the taxpayer has funded EVs for people who did not need financial support, nor one where we have a concentration of EVs in an area where they are least required. Therefore, we need to think about and target in the best way that we can the issue of forced car ownership. There are huge swathes of this country where there is forced car ownership. On our current trajectory, we will end up directing our subsidies everywhere but those areas. That is policy incoherence. The Government should be looking at increasing EV grants for those on lower incomes. In addition, a grant for buying a second-hand EV should be introduced, as it was in France. The aim of such a grant would be to assist people with the higher cost of purchasing a second-hand EV and to encourage the purchase of new EVs by sellers. That would contribute to the overall transition to a cleaner road network.  Charging points are also a key area that needs to be radically addressed. We need thousands more public EV points to give consumers confidence that chargers will be available island-wide, to encourage the purchase of electric cars and to reassure people they will not be left stranded. The public charge point grant scheme has been in place since September 2019. It aims to provide local authorities with a grant of up to €5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. While applications from 13 local authorities have been received to date, no chargers have been installed under the scheme. This is simply not good enough. I speak with local authorities. They talk about a lack of capacity in local authorities and a lack of familiarity with the technology. They are looking for a county to take on a pilot scheme and to be a lead agency in the roll-out of the service. Maybe the Minister could look at that.

It gives us an opportunity to debate two really important issues. In terms of data centres, this week we heard from experts at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action about the impact they are having, we have the EirGrid All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2019-2028 and we heard the Government outline its totally unsustainable, unrealistic and unbelievable position. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has stated that keeping oil and coal powered plants in operation for longer than intended will not impede out ability to meet our 2030 targets. Despite being only three months old, it appears those targets are being sidelined. The Government is quick to tell people that hard decisions will need to be taken in the transition to greener alternatives, but it clearly is not willing to practice what is preaches, rolling over immediately when big tech puts the pressure on. Sinn Féin supports a moratorium on the development of new data centres until an economic, environmental and energy security impact risk analysis has been carried out. As stated by Deputy Martin Kenny, we are supporting this Bill as we believe an in-depth debate on Committee Stage, where we can scrutinise stakeholders and look at the risk analyses, is an essential element. This Bill recognises the problem and provides an impetus for solution.  In terms of planning, this Bill also seeks to ensure LNG terminals and other fossil fuel infrastructure are removed from the Seventh Schedule to the Planning and Development Act 2000. Every euro invested in new fossil fuel infrastructure is a euro not spent on sustainable renewable alternatives. We have agreed on a 51% reduction by 2030 and an aim of a carbon neutral society by no later than 2050. New fossil fuel infrastructure simply does not fit into this plan. Sinn Féin is opposed to new infrastructure that will lock us into fossil fuel use for decades to come and will greatly impede the transition to a zero carbon economy. We support an outright ban on fracked gas. We have opposed fracking across this island and we are opposed to importing fracked gas. We were concerned that a commitment in this regard was not included in the recent climate action plan or in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. We suspect this omission was due to provisions of the investor clause in the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT. We believe the ECT poses a huge threat to climate action here. It protects foreign investors in the energy sector from any changes in Government policies regarding energy that would impact on their profit or expected future profits. Any future Government that would try to phase out LNG terminals would potentially be faced with an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, claim in a closed door investor tribunal that has no appeal mechanism. This happened to the Dutch. They had a short-term energy problem as they were over-reliant on gas and prices went through the roof. In 2009, they invited coal fired power plants into the country. These opened in 2015 and 2016. To reach its climate targets, the Dutch now needs to phase out these plants by 2030. In February of this year, they were hit with two claims under the ECT, amounting to a minimum of €2.4 billion. We do not want the same to happen here. Not only could this ISDS mechanism lead to major liability for the State, it could result in regulatory chill, where the Government does not progress climate measures for fear of litigation.  Sinn Féin has called on the Irish Government to join other countries such as France and Spain in the call for the EU to leave the ECT. Failing agreement at an EU level, we believe the Government should set a deadline by which we should leave unilaterally. There is a sunset clause that locks us into liability for 20 years, but the ECT is so bad there is no argument for staying. Italy is already five years into its sunset period. If the Government is serious about climate action, we need to unshackle ourselves from this regressive treaty.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-06 09:10:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I thank People Before Profit-Solidarity for tabling this motion. This year, workers and families will be facing extraordinarily high energy costs at a time when most can least afford them. There have been over 30 price hike announcements from Irish energy suppliers since the start of the year, with some suppliers raising prices on multiple occasions. This is on top of other spiralling costs that the Government has completely failed to regulate, including rent, childcare, insurance and the basket of shopping; the list goes on. The Government does not seem to recognise the real hardship many people are facing due to these constant price hikes and has failed to bring forward any meaningful solutions for people.  Euro finance ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the energy crisis and we heard calls for strong co-ordinated action on this. Some EU member states, such as Spain, France and Italy, are already acting unilaterally and with appropriate urgency. In Ireland, the Government sits on its hands. It is essential emergency action is taken here to protect households from crippling energy price hikes. Whether it is through the consumer Acts or another mechanism, Ministers cannot sit on their hands as people go cold, hungry or potentially die as they struggle to cope with heating bills this winter. These huge price rises are an emergency and need to be treated as such in the budget announcement next week.  There are measures the Government can take. Last year, I published a Bill that would ban utility disconnections during the fuel allowance season. This is an important protection that should be introduced. We cannot have a position where those facing financial difficulty have their gas or electricity cut off in the middle of winter for failure to meet their bills on time. Even having the threat of disconnections hanging over families is incredibly stressful. Yesterday, at a committee meeting, we heard from representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities on this issue. Other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium, have winter disconnection bans and such a protection should also be introduced here.  The electricity public service obligation, PSO, must be reformed. It should be levied on overall demand, not peak demand as is now the case. Residential consumers are responsible for approximately 42% of peak demand but only 28% of total demand. Industrial consumers, meanwhile, are responsible for 47% of peak demand and 44% of overall demand. Despite contributing less to overall demand than industrial users, residential electricity users' outsized contribution to peak demand means they are apportioned an outsized share of the PSO. We want to change this to ensure large electricity users, such as data centres, pay their fair share of the PSO based on their overall demand for electricity, rather than ordinary households shouldering the heaviest burden.  To add absolute insult to injury for families, the Government still intends to carry on, with complete disregard, with carbon tax hikes, adding to the burden on families, with an extra €1.50 on a fill of motor fuel, an extra €13 on the average gas bill and an extra €20 per tank of home heating oil. What is the Government's argument for this? We have heard the money will be used to offset carbon impact and we need it anyway to invest in climate projects. The real world is a foreign place for this Government. The truth, of course, is that welfare supports go nowhere near covering the impact of these hikes. What about the promised climate action spend? How many houses have been retrofitted in the past year? The number is little or none. How many cold homes have been insulated? How many heat pumps have been installed? It is a fraction of what was committed to and an even smaller fraction of what is needed.  How many new public transport routes have been provided? There has been none, not even one. I have repeatedly seen a response from the National Transport Authority indicating ""2021 does not include provision for the introduction of new or improved services in these areas"". In my county I can think of communities like Carlanstown, which appears in our local newspaper this week and has no service. Kentstown is a village that had a service years ago, when there was just one housing estate in the place, and now it has no service, despite having a far greater population. Elsewhere, existing services to Dublin City University have been reduced.  All of this is happening while the Government is subsidising millionaires to drive electric supercars and running our energy system to the brink of collapse to facilitate big technology foreign direct investment. It is really a case of one rule for some and another for the rest of us. This Government just does not get it. It is out of touch, out of ideas and with any good luck for the Irish people, it is running out of time fast."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-07 09:00:00+01:00	Recovery of Tourism and Aviation: Statements	1	The aviation sector was one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and it was recognised from the outset, and again here today, that it will take much longer to recover compared with others. The industry employs, directly and indirectly, over 140,000 people and it is vital to our economy and society as an island nation. Many of these workers faced savage cuts over the past 18 months and the vast majority are still not on their full wages or working hours. There are real concerns about their prospects of getting back to that point. This has a real impact on families, communities and local economies.  We should not forget the experience of these dedicated workers. Newspaper headlines indicated that cabin crew were struggling to feed their families at a time when their employer was receiving hundreds of millions of euro in State support, all while that employer and the Department of Social Protection pointed fingers at each other over short-term work supports. This was the absolute worst of the pandemic. It was shameful and it is continuing in that company, and in other companies in aviation, as the sector tries to exploit the pandemic.  The Minister of State will be aware of very significant industrial relations issues across the aviation sector. Last month, Aer Lingus ground staff and cabin crew both rejected efforts by the company to target their work terms and conditions in order to offset losses at the airline. These workers already faced massive income losses during the pandemic. Permanent cuts to their working conditions will not help the sector to recover. Aer Lingus is seeking to take advantage of the pandemic after it received hundreds of millions of euro in support from taxpayers. The State must intervene to protect jobs in the sector.   Similarly, the DAA's attempt to outsource front-line maintenance work is disgraceful and something Sinn Féin opposes. This is a semi-State company. Outsourcing is far too often the precursor to further attacks on the terms and conditions of workers. This is not acceptable and it should be opposed in the strongest terms. Furthermore, members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications have all received correspondence from air traffic control workers highlighting a litany of concerns about the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. I have written to the Minister of State on this but have yet to receive a substantive reply.  I know the Minister of State cannot comment specifically on all these cases, but it is very important that reassurance is provided in the House today that the Government is engaging on these issues. We cannot leave these matters, and the future of our aviation sector, to the whim of the market. If we do that, we can forget about regional balance. The State must use its position. We need to bear in mind we are an island nation. Far too often, Ministers have washed their hands of transport matters and let industrial relations issues spiral out of control. We do not want to see that happen now as the aviation sector begins to recover.  It is also essential that the State continues to support these workers. I hope the Minister of State will provide some insight on the medium-term supports the Government is planning. There has been a clear call from workers and their unions in the sector for an aviation-specific employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to be put in place to support workers until the sector recovers. Last month, the Minister of State told me the Government is having constructive conversations on this as part of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, subgroup. I would like an update on that. I noted nothing was forthcoming in her opening comments. The extension is about getting us over the shoulder. People in the sector are saying they have missed their season, which does not start again until around St. Patrick's Day.  The Minister of State mentioned the Fit for 55 EU-level package. There is an opportunity for Ireland to be a leader in the transition towards alternative fuels. We do not have a hydrogen strategy and we should have one. There is an opportunity in that. We are in a unique position on international aviation and we can be leaders in the field. Otherwise, we will be playing catch-up.  From a tourism perspective, we want to make travel as convenient as possible for people, while also having appropriate public health measures in place. Do we have any indication of the date on which routes to the United States will reopen? Many people are very interested in that and it has a major impact on the aviation sector. A query that comes up time and again relates to vaccinated individuals. Very many people in Ireland received the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not licensed in the United States. Will it be accepted there? Does the Minister of State have any information on that? It is a query. I hope the vaccine would be accepted given the number of people in Ireland who have been vaccinated with it.   I will speak about the coach tourism sector, which is related to the briefs of both the Minister and the Minister of State in different ways. Representatives of that sector have outlined the major challenges it faces. They have identified a number of measures they believe need to be taken to get them back on their feet and sustain them through this period. They, too, have called for an extension of the EWSS and specific targeted supports for the sector. They are facing challenges with forbearance and depreciation of assets. This is a sector deserving of significant support and I encourage both the Minister and the Minister of State to engage with it positively.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-13 10:30:00+01:00	Financial Resolution No. 2: General (Resumed)	1	"In the time available to me, I want to contest the argument made by various Government representatives in support of the claim by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday that: ""Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off..."". I heard George Lee make the same statement yesterday on ""Six One News"". It is my understanding that this claim is made on the back of an Economic and Social Research Institute report, Carbon Taxes, Poverty and Compensation Options, which was published in October 2020. That research deserves further scrutiny given the influence it is now having. Like any research, it has its limitations, and those limitations need to be discussed. I want to make five points in that regard.  First, the authors say they do not account for changes in prices beyond those directly arising from the higher carbon tax. They do not account for the higher prices firms charge for their products because of changes to input prices. This is significant because we know the wholesale price of natural gas has increased by 250% since January. Brent crude oil is at more than $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. On my reading of the paper, that is not factored into the model.  Second, the report notes that energy poverty is beset with measurement issues. It also notes that there was a commitment in the 2016 strategy to combat energy poverty to establish an energy poverty advisory group to review and report to the Minister on an appropriate methodology for measuring and tracking energy poverty levels in Ireland. This would be an important thing to do if there was a real wish to understand and address energy poverty in the midst of runaway energy costs and ensure a just transition. However, this group has yet to be convened or to meet. The ESRI researchers were constrained in this regard by Government action. When they assessed the impact of the range of redistributive measures on energy poverty, they found that at disposable incomes of greater than 10%, 15% and 20% after housing costs, none had a mitigating effect. That is there in black and white on page 11 of the report.  Third, in making the case that energy or fuel poverty is primarily one of inadequate resources, the researchers abandoned the energy poverty measurement and moved to the official at-risk-of-poverty rate. That is a questionable move in and of itself. We should also note that the eight mitigating measures they assessed do not map directly to the measures taken by Government. Option B, for example, refers to a €6.50, rather than a €5, rise in the fuel allowance. I raise this as another limitation in terms of the conclusions that are being drawn by Government spokespersons.  Fourth, in regard to the impact on specific groups, the report concludes: In terms of geographic impact, an increase in the carbon tax would disproportionately affect those living in rural areas, with or without any compensation measures. However, as [shown elsewhere], this is driven by the particularly large effects on those living in rural areas who commute long distances to work by car. Given the ongoing pandemic and public health advice to work from home where possible, such differential impacts may be moderated by a reduction in long-distance commuting by car. That argument hardly holds true now and the differential impacts will not be moderated.  My final point relates to renters, in respect of whom the report authors conclude: Renters - both in the private and social sector - would be left on average better-off by those measures which raised the personal rate of working-age benefit payments or Increases for Qualified Children... This is because those renting are disproportionately likely to be in receipt of a social welfare payment. The problem with aggregate data is that they lead to the drawing of aggregate conclusions when we know the picture is far from uniform within and between groups. That has been clearly shown by a number of people who have taken the time to map energy poverty in Ireland and look at the risk index. The picture is not uniform and hundreds of thousands of renters are not in receipt of social welfare payments. They got no relief in the budget yesterday and are being penalised with carbon taxes. It is really important that we dig down into the detail of the data on which the claims that are being made by Government representatives are based. I call on the Government to publish the data from which it derives the claim that there has been relief for the real impact of the carbon taxes. On my reading of the document on which it is relying in this regard, the evidence is not there."

Thousands of children were excluded from the scheme due to the infamous concessionary ticket classification. We were promised that this would be kept under review. Parents and Bus Éireann were looking towards 22 October for the possible reintroduction of 100% refunds, which would ordinarily have been issued, but they have been held back. Will the school transport system return to 100% after the mid-term break or, if not, are there plans to increase capacity?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-21 09:00:00+01:00	Breast Cancer Awareness Month: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. As numerous Deputies have said, there is barely a household breast cancer has not affected, not to mention their extended families. I worked in cancer diagnostics for years. There is no screening programme for many cancers but there is one for breast cancer because we have a very good diagnostic tool and an effective treatment in many cases. That provides us with a great opportunity and we must make the most of that opportunity. Numerous Deputies spoke about Covid, the cyberattack and the impact that has had. It is really important that we get back on track and, in fact, go beyond. Participation rates in the national cancer programme, the centres of excellence and the various screening programmes have fluctuated. Some of that relates to resources while some relates to capacity. We need to strive to continue to improve and I am sure the Minister of State will want to do likewise.  A number of Deputies spoke about raising awareness, as we are doing with this debate, and reiterating the call to people to attend their appointments for screening. We also need to understand why people are not attending and whether there are patterns within that. That would be of benefit. We also need to consider extending the scheme to younger age cohorts.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-09 14:00:00+00:00	Regional Transport Infrastructure: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. It is incredible that on the day the national development plan was launched, we were told by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that there were projects included in it that will never be delivered. That made sense, however, to any of us who read it, given that it provided for €5.1 billion for new roads, €800 million of which was already committed to roads at construction, but there was a long list of 30-odd projects at a cost of approximately €1 billion each. We could see straight away that the numbers did not add up. Despite this, two days later, to appease disgruntled backbenchers, we were told by the Taoiseach that there were things not included in the plan that would be delivered. That said it all. It is exactly what one gets when there is a coalition pulling in different directions and for different reasons. It was clear the Government could not agree what needed to come out of the plan, so nothing came out of the plan. It was a charade and an embarrassment and it would be a joke if it were not so serious.  There is any number of reasons that the NDP is hugely important. It should be a statement of the commitment of the State to lead in delivering balanced regional development and strategic development. There is an important point that has not been picked up on in the debate, namely, that there seems to be a dangerous shift in decision-making processes. Instead of trying to create an overarching plan in a logical way, there is a shift to a kind of survival-of-the-fittest strategy. We are told projects will proceed on the basis of which of them get through planning and reach the starting line, or the famous decision-making gates, first. It will be very difficult in this scenario to provide a counterbalance to the already dominant regions.  I could say more about rail and roads provision but there is not time. The plan is not good enough. The Government has a second chance to get it right by supporting the Sinn Féin motion.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Rising Costs and Supply Security for Fuel and Energy: Motion [Private Members]	1	"It has been merely a number of weeks since we previously debated a motion on energy prices. This shows how important this issue is. In these few weeks we have witnessed yet more price hikes from suppliers but we have seen absolutely no action from the Government to address the crisis. There have been more than 35 price hike announcements from Irish suppliers this year. They are having a crippling effect on families. A dual customer of Flogas, for example, will pay €1,385 more this year than last. This is an unprecedented increase in costs. The Government seems to be blind to this reality. Where are workers and families supposed to get this extra money? The sky-high cost of living driven by out-of-control rents, and we will hear more on this today, along with childcare costs and other costs have put people to the pin of their collar and beyond. Thousands of families will soon have to turn off their heating or put on extra layers of clothing to keep the heating off in the depths of winter as they simply will not have the money to meet these bills.  Not only is the Government failing to act but it is contributing to the crisis. According to figures from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, 16.2% of an electricity bill is made up of Government charges in VAT and the public service obligation, PSO, levy while 17.4% of gas bills are made up of Government charges comprising carbon tax and VAT. This is before excise and other duties. In agreeing to exacerbate this issue by increasing the carbon tax, pushing up gas and home heating oil prices even further, the Government is both tone deaf and belligerent. Sinn Féin has consistently highlighted the unfairness of the carbon tax on heating people's homes when they have no alternative. This is certainly the case for many families and it is most certainly the case for haulage companies and others dependent on fuel. It is a punitive measure.  One argument the Government makes in defence of the punitive carbon tax is that some of it, a fraction of it, will be recycled to assist those who need it most but this argument simply does not hold up. The climate action plan states €9.5 billion from carbon tax will be ring-fenced for retrofitting, social welfare payments and agri-environmental projects. However, in reality there is a serious question mark over this funding and the actions to be funded by it. If the carbon tax is successful, receipts should be falling by the end of the decade and this is not taken into account. Second, and this is where the more serious issue arises, the EU Commission's Fit for 55 climate package proposes to take 70% to 80% of all carbon tax receipts into a central EU fund with Ireland as a net contributor. This leaves a black hole in the Government's finances and completely undermines the retrofitting targets and the promised social protection increases. As it stands, carbon tax will increase each year, all while Europe is positioning itself to siphon away the vast majority of it to redistribute it across Europe. This is a charge the Government has never addressed. Regardless, no level of carbon tax redistribution will address the immediate crisis. We need urgent and immediate action from the Government.  In recent weeks, my party leader, Deputy McDonald, asked the Taoiseach whether he would cut VAT on electricity over the winter months to provide households with some breathing space on utility bills. The Taoiseach had no answers on that day and has taken no action since. The Minister for Finance was similarly intransigent with my colleague, Deputy Doherty, when he raised the same issue last night. The figures we have received from the Department of Finance show the State collected €228 million in VAT on domestic electricity bills in 2020. How on earth can the Government stand over this, given the financial pressure workers and families are facing this year? The European Commission has said EU countries can reduce VAT and energy taxes, issue fuel vouchers, defer utility bills and ban grid disconnections to help families get through the winter months. While other EU countries have taken such action, the Irish Government has left Irish households to fend for themselves. It is a dereliction of duty and something that needs to change.  To get us out of this energy crisis the Government states we need a massive move away from fossil fuels towards renewables. For this we need a new grid. Today, EirGrid launched its Shaping Our Electricity Future plan, another glossy plan that states commitments to deliver essential grid capacity. It includes an outline of the key developments needed for networks, engagement, operations and market perspective to support a secure transition to at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030, in its words. I want to speak about engagement, particularly as it relates to the North-South interconnector. It is easy to write it on a page or say it is important but I do not believe EirGrid knows the meaning of it, unless ""engagement"" means predetermining outcome and driving through regardless; patronising local communities when they put forward reasonable and fair arguments; picking the information that suits its argument and ignoring other perspectives; or throwing taxpayers' money at sponsorship deals in a hopeless attempt to win over the people. In the most recent example, my local newspaper is reporting is a charge made by local communities in County Monaghan that EirGrid secretly intruded on the land of private landowners. There was no request made for access and no notice given. This is all at a time when a Government review of the project itself is under way. No one is holding out hope for the review because the terms of reference are so constrained. "
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	This is wide-ranging legislation. The transport committee undertook pre-legislative scrutiny over the past few months. Many aspects of the Bill seek to make our roads safer from variable speed limits to regulating e-scooters to giving gardaí more powers to check for uninsured vehicles on our roads. Sinn Féin welcomes these provisions. We support making our roads safer and trying to reduce the number of serious collisions and fatalities on our roads each year. The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, including tackling the dangerous use of scramblers, providing for the testing of autonomous vehicles on our roads, amending how fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens are dealt with and linking driver licence records with vehicle registration records. There is a huge amount in the Bill. Sinn Féin will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage which we think will improve the Bill and add positively to our road traffic legislation. I look forward to engaging with the Minister on that.  The popularity of e-scooters has accelerated in recent years, with a significant number of people now using them to commute to and from work and school. The rapid growth has bypassed current road traffic legislation and has left significant gaps in the law that need to be addressed. E-scooters are a cleaner, cheaper form of transport compared with cars and their use is only expected to grow. I welcome the efforts in this Bill to address their use on our roads. There is considerable detail on this and we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to unpack some of that. Introducing laws is not about punishing e-scooter users but, rather, putting protections in place for their safety and that of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.  A number of issues will need further discussion and interrogation when this Bill comes to Committee Stage, namely, the wearing of helmets and high-visibility clothing; the use of lights; areas where e-scooters can be used, including geofencing; liability; maximum speeds and power; and age limits. On Committee Stage, it will also be important to examine proposed e-scooter sharing schemes. These are commonplace across Europe and are hugely popular with tourists and residents alike. However, there is also concern over some of the negative aspects that can arise if a shared scheme is not introduced correctly. We do not want to see e-scooters used on footpaths or strewn all over sidewalks and public spaces, like we see in some cases elsewhere. This causes huge issues for people, particularly those with visual impairments, elderly people and people with a disability, as e-scooters can constitute serious hazards if they are not appropriately used or stored. It is, therefore, vital we develop appropriate pick-up and drop-off points for shared schemes. This will be an important issue to address on Committee Stage and I encourage the Minister of State to engage with groups such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland to hear their suggestions and to work with them to address their legitimate concerns and on the shape of the regulations that will follow.  E-bikes are another aspect of modern transport this Bill seeks to regulate for the first time. This is a positive initiative as it will help encourage this alternative form of mobility, reduce reliance on private cars and open opportunities for active and healthy travel for more people. I ask the Minister of State to advise the House whether she is considering expanding or reforming the bike-to-work scheme to take account of the growth of e-bikes and e-cargo bikes. As far as I am aware, €1,500 is the maximum cost that can be applied for the scheme, but some e-bikes and e-cargo bikes cost in excess of that. E-bikes cost a fraction of what an electric vehicle costs and take up much less room on our roads. While their regulation in this Bill is welcome, I hope the Government is planning to bring forward updated incentives to increase their use. The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard about the potential of e-bikes to make medium-distance travel more manageable for people.  On scramblers and quad bikes, Sinn Féin has consistently called for action and legislative reform to tackle the dangerous and illegal use of these bikes. My colleagues, Deputies Ellis, Munster and Paul Donnelly, brought forward legislation in this Dáil and the previous Dáil to regulate this area. Unfortunately, successive Governments have sat on their hands while communities continue to be tormented by their use. The misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in parks and public spaces, particularly in urban communities, is a significant problem. Many people feel frightened, unsafe and intimidated by the rogue use of these scrambler bikes in public areas, which should be shared spaces for everyone to enjoy safely. In addition, there have been very serious incidents, including relatively recently.  The Minister of State indicated the aim of these amendments is to ensure prosecutions for dangerous driving may be taken against those who use scramblers or other similar vehicles in a dangerous way in any location, altering the public space definition. We are also told the Bill seeks to strengthen the powers of An Garda Síochána when dealing with the illegal use of scramblers and quad bikes, including the explicit seizing of these bikes. It is imperative the provisions in this Bill are fit for purpose to finally address this problem. This is as much an issue for the Department of Justice as it is for the Department of Transport. The Minister for Justice and the Garda need to be involved in this. The most important step that must take place following the passing of this legislation is the implementation of these new laws by the Garda. We will seek a meeting with senior Garda management to ensure a strategy is put in place to enforce the laws and the Garda has the resources to do so.  Section 5(l) of this Bill amends section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which deals with traffic signs. We welcome this initiative, which will allow Transport Infrastructure Ireland to proceed with dynamic traffic management on the M50 in the first instance, giving it the power to change speed limits on sections of the network. Drivers will be notified of such changes via lane control signals along the road and on overhead gantries. The aim of this is to allow TII to close lanes temporarily and slow traffic approaching an area where there has been an accident or traffic build-up, in order to improve the dispersion of congestion and avoid further collisions.  Members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications visited TII’s operations centre in East Wall this week and saw at first hand the impressive work it does there monitoring the motorway network and keeping motorists safe. I echo the recommendation of the committee that Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Road Safety Authority run a public information campaign before the launch of the eMOS system on the M50 to ensure motorists are aware of the introduction and enforcement of variable speed limits and dynamic lane control. I note TII did that before it launched its early pilots. It is also important that the Department of Transport, TII and the RSA should monitor and analyse the report on the progress of the eMOS system on the M50 before proceeding with any further projects for other Irish motorways and I note the Minister of State's comments on that.  I briefly raise the High Court judgment from last week relating to driving licences. The judgment quashed a decision by the RSA which refused to exchange South African driving licences, citing residency issues as the applicants were in the direct provision system. The programme for Government contains a commitment to improve conditions for asylum seekers and specifically cites the ability to obtain a driving licence but this has still not been acted on. It is disappointing the applicants in this case were forced to take legal action in the first place but the successful outcome of their case is very welcome. I noted in a newspaper article at the weekend that a spokesperson for the Minister or the Department indicated an amendment to this legislation might be the place to address this matter. When does the Minister intend to address this judgment and what impact will that have on the wider driving licence system?  I am conscious that while the Minister for Transport was in Glasgow this week, hammering home the need to reduce emissions and get people on public transport, the NTA and the Government were announcing the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area which seemed to be on a completely different page. The provisions in the Bill set out a number of measures covering automatic vehicles, e-bikes and e-scooters. There are significant proposals and this Bill legislates for many aspects which align well with the direction of travel, for want of a better term, towards the type transport of infrastructure and model we will have in the future. However, much of what we saw yesterday in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, many of the provisions in the national development plan and the level of funding for Connecting Ireland, for example, do the opposite. I note the plan moves away from the Navan rail line and MetroLink projects and puts light rail on the long finger and heavy rail on a longer finger. There is a mismatch between the rhetoric and the policy and, certainly, the delivery. That needs to be addressed in the time ahead.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-10 09:12:00+00:00	Science Week 2021: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. I thank the Business Committee for scheduling it and Deputy Naughten who was involved in ensuring that was the case. I commend Deputy Naughten on his chairmanship of the Houses of the Oireachtas Friends of Science group, of which I am a member. I do not get to it as much as I might like, but it is a very useful forum.  There is a huge opportunity for Ireland in science, research and innovation. There are opportunities in the green, digital, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. I would like to see the State take a leading role in creating the environment for progress. I welcome the establishment of the Department. I do not think we are there yet with the Department. I have submitted parliamentary questions asking the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science what efforts the Minister is making to position Ireland as a world leader in renewable energy, research and development. It is a reasonable question. It was diverted to another Department. Everyone in this Chamber knows what happens if one’s question does not meet that standard and it is diverted elsewhere, it tells you something about the question you are asking or the Department's interest in responding to it. I encourage the Department to take on a cross-cutting role in research, innovation and to set the bar high.   I want to make a point on our working scientists in Ireland. I was one before in a previous life. Yesterday we heard that medical scientists voted for industrial action up to and including strike action. That is a very significant move. My colleague Deputy Louise O’Reilly also mentioned this. This group has taken this step only once in the past 60 years. It seeks pay parity with biochemist colleagues, colleagues who do the same work but are paid more. They are an excellent example of Irish science research, innovation and potential but that potential is being denied and is being lost due to the intransigence of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health. That needs to change. I find the whole thing incredible. We have brilliantly trained scientists, experts, a wealth of knowledge, a tremendous asset and resource to our State and to science and innovation, and instead of saying “Yes, let us realise the potential of this and maximise the benefit for the public good, for science and for innovation”, the State is saying “No, there is a glass ceiling and you will go no further”. It has built in a punitive level of inequality. The State is cutting its nose to spite its face and losing credibility and good people at the same time. I implore the Minister of State to take back that to his colleagues in government, to get around the table and get it resolved. It is a 20-year-old agreement that has not been delivered on.   In the coming weeks, I will bring forward legislation not dissimilar to a Bill the Minister of State’s former colleague, former Deputy Billy Kelleher, brought forward on the transfer of value and payments from the pharmaceutical industry to healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations. It is an important thing to do. We want to be proactive and create an environment where industry works with the public sector, third level and communities. We saw this with the Creating our Future initiative, which is very welcome but there needs to be transparency and accountability and a public return on a public good. I ask that the Government would engage with that transparency legislation when I bring it forward in the coming weeks. It would be for the betterment of scientific endeavour in this country. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-17 09:10:00+00:00	National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	1	"I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this Bill. It seeks to amend the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996 in order to ""confer functions on the [NSAI] in relation to promoting the use of standard specifications and standard marks to give information about the carbon footprint of commodities, process and practices"". Sinn Féin will support the Bill.  It is important now and will be increasingly so into the future that we have such mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability. We have heard speakers from the Labour Party and they agree the Bill will not crack that nut but is a step in the right direction and can be built upon. There are questions in terms of how we operationalise such a system of accounting but it will be important, not least because we already see how some large corporations are bombarding consumers with more and more dubious claims about their green credentials.  My colleague, Senator Boylan, has highlighted how several energy suppliers that claim to offer electricity from 100% renewable sources are simultaneously raising their prices during this period of extortionate gas prices on the international markets. That raises the question of how companies who are supposedly 100% renewable are so exposed to the volatility in the gas market. At least part of the answer relates to the fact they are not 100% renewable, but by marketing manoeuvre and advertising sleight of hand, they present it as such. When a person signs up to a 100% renewable supplier, he or she is probably expecting the electricity will be generated by wind, solar or hydropower but, in many cases, 100% renewable involves suppliers getting electricity from whatever fossil fuel source they like and buying certificates to offset the non-renewable electricity, so-called guarantees of origin. One guarantee of origin corresponds to 1 MWh of renewable electricity. It is a financial document. If a supplier wants 100% renewable electricity, it buys from a producer that offers the guarantees alongside the sales. An energy supplier offering 100% renewable can buy the guarantees from anywhere in Europe but the electricity delivered will still most likely come from fossil fuel power plants in Ireland or on the Continent. For example, a consumer on a 100% renewable tariff could be getting coal-fired power from Moneypoint. On paper, it reads as 100% renewable because the supplier has bought guarantees, but it is not. This practice is damaging because people have a right to know where their energy is coming from. If people want to avoid fossil fuels, there is no way of knowing which energy companies do not use them.  Several of the 18 suppliers that had their fuel mixes disclosed this week by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, claimed to be 100% renewable but this is not the case. Customers are being misled and this needs to be addressed. This is one example, but greenwashing, as has already been referenced, is bad and getting worse. While this Bill seeks to appoint the NSAI to provide independent and comparable figures that include corporate processes and practices in recognisable and reliable standard measures, we also need tighter advertising standards to ensure companies cannot make outlandish climate claims, green claims or greenwashing claims without rigorous oversight and verification. This stuff really does matter. The current advertising standards are not robust enough.  Elsewhere, the Bill seeks to introduce carbon footprint information on all products. The aim of this would be to provide consumers with information about the environmental impacts of products, in a similar vein to how ingredients or calories are presented on products. Some companies already do this voluntarily. For example, Quorn, the meat alternative company has carbon labelling on some products, and BrewDog, the brewery, pub and restaurant chain, highlights the carbon footprint of individual items on its menu. The widespread use and standardisation of such an approach would provide for improved tracing, transparency, accountability and better information for consumers, remembering the old maxim to the effect that if you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it. It should not simply be seen as a tool to influence consumer behaviour. That is an important point and I do not think that is the suggestion from the proposers.   We are in a climate crisis. We need to address the root causes of the crisis and we need systems change in energy, transport, economics and food. While individuals can and will play their part, the focus should not be diverted from the major corporations that are responsible for huge amounts of emissions or from the failure of successive governments to take appropriate action and lead from the front to stem the impact of climate change. The climate crisis will not be tackled by shifting the focus onto individual behaviours or individual consumer choices. Carbon labelling can be for the climate crisis what calorific labelling is for the obesity epidemic. It can be a waste of time, an irrelevance, or worse, a tool to be used to give the semblance of action as powerful corporations drive on, ever more rampant and reckless. Other forces at play, such as predatory advertising, need to be tackled. Tighter regulation and proper deterrents are needed in tandem with providing consumers with more information if we are to tackle this issue successfully.  We need to recognise the disproportionate contribution of the world's wealthiest on the climate emergency. Last week, the CEO of Amazon waxed lyrical about climate change at COP26. With no shame, the same man took a vanity trip to space a few weeks before. He did not mention that or the fact that a few miles up the road from Glasgow in Dunfermline, Amazon was found to be in the practice of destroying millions of items in unsold stock every year, including smart TVs, laptops, drones and hairdryers. Let us not talk about product obsolescence. I welcome the moves the Government is making in relation to the circular economy and that needs to happen as quickly as possible.   Oxfam's report on confronting carbon inequality highlights the fact that during a critical 25-year period of unprecedented emissions growth, the richest 1% of the world's population were responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorer half of humanity. Ordinary people would be correct in thinking there is one rule for them and one for the wealthy when it comes to climate action. We will not successfully tackle the climate crisis with a business as usual,  One area where the State is outsourcing its obligations is offshore wind. We have almost unlimited potential for green offshore winds but the slow pace of planning and regulation is putting off some investors and the State is not leading from the front. Sinn Féin acknowledged the role of private companies in the development of offshore wind but we want to see semi-State bodies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna invest, develop and, importantly, retain ownership of renewable energy projects. It is essential the State does not become as reliant on private renewable energy production as it is on fossil fuels energy production now. The constant energy price hikes demonstrate how dependent and exposed the State is to volatility in the international energy markets and highlight the need to eliminate this threat.   I welcome the legislation and note the Government's amendment. It is an approach the Government has used consistently. It buys a year. I urge that action take place. We are in the middle of a climate emergency and need to see action. I am concerned in another respect. There is lots that could be done at European level. Some of what this Bill could deliver is, for example, an assessment of the carbon labelling of mushrooms grown on Irish peat versus international horticultural peat. Similarly, there is the comparison between Irish beef and Brazilian beef.  That is an important contribution it could make. The European Union also has a responsibility in terms of the Mercosur deal and international trade deals. It needs to watch its own carbon footprint as well.  I also want to make reference to young people, who are ahead of us in this regard. At the last Young Scientist competition I attended, a local school from my own area, Eureka Secondary School, put forward proposals in line with this. We need to get on board with that."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-17 09:10:00+00:00	Air Accident Investigation Unit Final Report into R116 air accident: Statements	1	"At the outset I join the Minister and colleagues across the House in expressing my deepest sympathies and those of my party to the families, friends and colleagues of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smith and winch operator Paul Ormsby. The crew of R116 epitomised the courage, bravery, selflessness and dedication to the welfare of others that are the hallmark of members and volunteers of the Irish Coast Guard and our emergency services. Today we remember them. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse.  The extensive final report on the crash of the R116 helicopter in March 2017 was published by the AAIU earlier this month. It included detailed findings and recommendations. I thank the members of the AAIU for their vital work in investigating this incident and preparing this report. I welcome the comments from the Minister for Transport that he fully accepts the recommendations contained in the report. However, accepting these recommendations is not enough and I would like the Minister to outline a timeline for when each of the 42 safety recommendations will be fully addressed and implemented.  As colleagues have said, the Minister's statement was a very detailed one and will take time to consider. Noting that the safety recommendations relate to several parties such as the IAA, CHC Ireland, the Department itself, the Sikorsky Aircraft corporation, the European Commission and EASA, how does the Minister intend to ensure each party responds and acts appropriately to the recommendations that apply to it? What mechanism will be put in place to ensure that happens on a co-ordinated basis? Some people have suggested a co-chaired working group model or a stakeholder forum. I would be interested to hear the Minister's perspective.  It is essential that each of the recommendations is acted on with haste to ensure everything is done to try to prevent another such tragedy. A deadline should be set for departmental officials or the Minister to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to report on the full implementation of the 42 safety recommendations. I know significant detail was given to the House tonight, but it would be appropriate to submit that information to the committee and to have it line up against the 42 recommendations. I would welcome the Minister's opinion on this approach.  The AAIU detailed 71 findings in the conclusion of its report. These findings raise serious questions for the State, its agencies and the operator. For example, contributory cause No. 12 identified that there was confusion at State level regarding responsibility for oversight of SAR operations in Ireland. The Minister referred to this in his contribution.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill, which seeks to significantly redesign air navigation services in the State, is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad. Is the Minister satisfied the confusion regarding responsibility for oversight of SAR operations in Ireland has now been fully resolved? Are any changes needed to the Bill to make this key responsibility more explicit?  Regarding the maps, charts and imagery available to the crew on the night, the report found that Black Rock was not in the enhanced ground proximity warning system, EGPWS, databases; the 1:250,000 aeronautical chart, Euronav, imagery did not extend as far as Black Rock; and the 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey of Ireland, OSI, imagery available on the Toughbook did not show Black Rock Lighthouse or terrain and appeared to show open water in the vicinity of Black Rock. Even to an ordinary person reading this report, these findings are striking and pose sobering questions about the aeronautical data available to the crew of R116 on the night.  The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has been in contact with the Minister about the role of the IAA in overseeing the provision of accurate charts and aeronautical data as set out by ICAO obligations. IALPA has stated that the crew “relied on the data production standards of Irish regulation to guarantee them correct information. They were let down.” It is hard to disagree with that assessment on reading the report.  Raising concerns some time beforehand on 26 June 2013, one of the operator’s pilots emailed several other personnel, advising that the Blacksod south route had been flown the previous night and it was noticed that Black Rock Lighthouse was not shown on the EGPWS. The pilot stated that at 310 ft. high, the lighthouse was an obvious hazard and suggested that although it was mentioned in the route notes, the EGPWS issue should be highlighted as well. The following day, on 27 June, a different pilot emailed several of the same personnel, advising that Inishmurray and Black Rock were not contained in the EGPWS databases.  The next day, on 28 June, one of the operator’s pilots emailed the EGPWS manufacturer advising that: ""a few Islands and lighthouses locally... do not appear on the database. Is it possible to get these obstructions added to the database? If so, how do we go about it?"" The manufacturer replied stating it would examine the matter. The manufacturer later told investigators that it could not find any evidence it had been provided with “specific actionable data on what islands and lighthouses to add”, and the matter was regrettably closed in March 2015 with no action taken. It is devastating to read that concern about this critical information was raised four years before the R116 crash, but no action was taken to address it. I hope new processes have been put in place to ensure critical pieces of information about mapping errors are acted upon and addressed with appropriate urgency when they are identified.  The crew were provided with a low-level approach chart that started right above a fatal hazard. That hazard, Black Rock Island, was not adequately highlighted on charts and the charts had no vertical profile to provide crew with safe crossing heights. The crew had not been trained on all specific approaches on simulators and did not have ""prescribed recent experience"" of different landing sites.  In response to the AAIU report, the family of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick said that while there is a weighty responsibility on the operator to minimise the risk to the crew, this was not done on this occasion. They said they believed the crew members of R116 were badly let down by the operator not providing them with the safe operating procedures and training that they were entitled to expect.  It is impossible to read the report without thinking that many opportunities to mitigate risk were missed and wondering if the tragedy on the morning of 14 March 2017 would have been avoided if instead of being missed, corrective and preventative actions had been realised. What might have happened if the systems of operation, training, support and oversight were to the standard required?  Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, winchman Ciarán Smith and winch operator Paul Ormsby gave their lives in the courageous pursuit of protecting others. Nothing we say here will turn back time or ease the pain for their loved ones. The report from the AAIU provides the basis for ensuring that lessons are learned and acted on. It is an opportunity that should not be missed."

Despite this, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is intent on letting 34 driving testers go between now and next May. I ask the Minister to intervene to ensure they are not let go. Many of these testers were taken on under temporary contracts in 2017 and 2018. Those contracts have been renewed numerous times. Some of the testers are coming close to three years' service and, according to normal custom and practice, would be entitled to permanent contracts. I ask the Minister to intervene and ensure that is the case.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-23 14:00:00+00:00	Climate Action Plan 2021: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Sinn Féin recognises the urgency needed to tackle climate change, we back our national greenhouse emissions target and we worked constructively throughout the extensive consideration of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill. It is worth saying that unlike some in government who argued against interim targets, for example, now deemed an essential element of the plan, Sinn Féin argued for them. We agree on the need to act now and on our overall targets. In that respect, there is much we agree with in principle and practice in the climate action plan. We agree but we wonder why the Government lacks ambition and impetus, why it acts so slowly and, worse, why it acts contrary to the stated position. Elsewhere, this climate action plan is devoid of credibility, in particular when it comes to financing €125 billion in private finance, which has to come from somewhere, and related delivery. There is no shortage of plans and this needs to be not just another one.  Sinn Féin will continue to push for a just transition. This is something that, in the first instance, must be delivered for communities in the midlands, who have been listening to promises for a long time. Just transition must be extended beyond the midlands to all communities and all sectors. For some, the transition between a high and a low carbon economy is the difference between a new petrol Land Rover or a new Tesla, or a switch to public transport. For others, it is a matter of being able to heat their home, feed themselves and their family or having a job to go to in the morning. Just transition needs to move beyond rhetoric and I do not see that in the climate action plan. I do not believe the Government has done enough to show communities and sectors that a just transition is on the cards. It has not set out a vision for just transition in this climate action plan.  On energy, I welcome the new commitment in the plan to increase our target on renewable energy to 80% of our needs by 2030. Ireland is blessed with massive potential for offshore wind but, unfortunately, decades of under-ambition and painfully slow regulatory development have suffocated the exploitation of this vital natural resource. Almost 20 years on from its construction, Arklow Bank phase 1 remains Ireland's only offshore wind farm, with an output of just 25 MW. That is a damning indictment. Even now, on the brink of 2022, we still do not have a legislative framework in place for offshore wind generation. The industry representative body, Wind Energy Ireland, has warned that we have a narrowing window to meet the 2030 target and that was before it was increased to 80%. It highlights various areas that need to be addressed by government, including fixing the foreshore licensing system; providing more resources to relevant agencies; progressing renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the maritime area planning Bill; establishing an offshore grid steering committee; strengthening our electricity grid; and developing specific ports to ensure offshore wind farms can be built from our island.  The lack of action is already having consequences. Equinor pulled out of Ireland, citing the regulatory processes as one aspect of its decision for doing so. The Government did not bat an eyelid in response. This is a raging red alarm. Similarly, the guidelines for offshore wind are 15 years old. This has led to bad planning and animosity between some developers and rural communities. If the number of parliamentary questions and council motions being put forward by Government party representatives is anything to go by, I can say that it is accepted across the political spectrum that the guidelines are out of date and in desperate need of updating.  Meanwhile, the Government dithers and the same can be said about microgeneration. Communities have their hands up willing and wanting to play their part and the Government slaps them down. Similarly, hydrogen can play a key role in our energy transition. It could potentially provide a solution for some of the heavy industries and sectors where battery power is not feasible. Excess wind energy can be used to run electrolysers to produce green hydrogen. The fact that it can be stored and transported makes it particularly attractive to fill gaps in energy production when the wind does not blow, for example. Despite this, Ireland is one of only two European countries that does not have a hydrogen strategy in place. I cannot understand this. Is it a lack of capacity, expertise or ambition? I do not know what it is but something is lacking. The climate action plan fails to take hydrogen seriously. This is a mistake and one I would ask the Minister to act upon.  The MaREI institute has developed the TIMES-Ireland model to map out paths to 51% renewable energy generation by 2030, net zero by 2050 and beyond to 2070. It shows that it can be achieved, which is positive, and that the most efficient way to do it is to reduce demand. This is referred to as the low demand scenario. Then I think about Government Deputies cheerleading for data centres while the Government heaps carbon tax increases onto people who have no alternatives and no public transport, electric vehicles, EVs, heat pumps or retrofitted homes. We know that a significant majority of households use kerosene or solid fuels to heat their homes on these cold winter nights yet the Government rolls out the red carpet for data centres, which hoover up enormous amounts of energy. At the weekend, we read in the   I have been consistently putting forward ideas to kick-start emission reductions in the transport sector. School bus transport is significantly oversubscribed year on year but the current target outlined in Bus Éireann's sustainability strategy would only see a 20% increases in bus places by 2030. That is the equivalent of just 1,000 extra places each year. We are turning thousands of children away from public transport each year and putting them back in private cars, which makes no sense at all. Public transport fares are a huge barrier for many people and we are not seeing the ambition needed to reduce costs for people to encourage them to take the bus, train or tram, nor are we seeing the ambition to develop long overdue public transport infrastructure. Some mega projects continue to be delayed and some have been deferred into oblivion. Connecting Ireland is welcome and I do what the Opposition is supposed to do when we welcome a proposition. We encourage our constituents to engage with it and my constituents are ready to avail of the services. The difficulty is they will have to wait because funding is backloaded, with just 10% of funding allocated in year one and no guarantee of future funding.  This plan needs to be delivered on. The objectives of delivering on the emissions reductions are of deep and legitimate concern. We do not see a credible plan to get us there, bring communities with us and achieve those targets. The Minister of State needs to listen to the Opposition, communities and different sectors. They want to play their part but they need to be enabled to do so.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-24 09:10:00+00:00	Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The importance of the State's accident investigative units was highlighted in recent weeks with the publication of the final report into the R116 crash off the Mayo coast in 2017, which was a report and investigation conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU. This report laid out the extensive investigation carried out by the AAIU and made 42 safety recommendations to a number of parties, aimed at trying to prevent another terrible tragedy. The AAIU has responsibility for aviation accidents, while the Railway Accident Investigation Unit has responsibility for incidents on our railways and the equivalent for our vast maritime area is the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The MCIB was established in March 2003 under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000. In 2019, the MCIB commenced full investigations into ten separate incidents, which was double the number investigated in 2018. This included accidents at sea, in recreational fishing, kayaking and in the cargo shipping area. Three sinkings, six fatalities and one injury were also investigated by the MCIB in 2019. Its work is vital and I commend the investigators, the secretariat and the board on their essential work. I am, however, deeply concerned that the MCIB is not appropriately structured or resourced by the Government to a level commensurate with its degree of responsibility.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks heard evidence earlier this year that what we need for the maritime sector is an independent investigative unit headed by a full-time principal investigator, with full-time assistance from qualified maritime professionals, in line with what is currently in place for the aviation and rail sectors. That makes complete sense. Unfortunately, that provision is not in this Bill. This Bill, as the Minister of State has mentioned, is urgently needed in order to fill vacancies left at the MCIB as a result of a European court ruling last year. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union found that the composition of the MCIB was not adhering to EU regulations against potential conflicts of interest. Specifically, this concerned the chief surveyor and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, or their nominees, who were members of the board. Their membership could have been a conflict of interest, as the Department of Transport could be a party to any MCIB investigation. The two board members in question resigned their positions in the aftermath of the judgment and the board now comprises three members, with no process to fill the vacancies. This Bill will allow for the appointment of new board members, with a minimum of five and maximum of seven on the MCIB. While I welcome the ability of the board to gain new members and function effectively, this is just a sticking plaster when we consider what is needed, which is overall reform.   As mentioned, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks heard evidence on the need to reform and beef up the MCIB. I thank Mr. Michael Kingston and Mr. Ciaran McCarthy, who appeared as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process on this Bill in early 2021 and provided helpful assistance to members of the committee. In his evidence to us, Mr. Kingston highlighted the financial disparity with the other two investigative units, namely, the AAIU and the Railway Accident Investigation Unit. In 2019, the MCIB spent €27,000 on investigators in the field for ten incidents, including, tragically, six deaths in the maritime sector. A total of €750,000 was spent on aviation and €350,000 was spent on rail. These are the amounts spent on investigators in the field, leaving aside spending on administrative staff. This gap in funding highlights the significant difference in approach. Again, I do not wish to criticise the individuals working at the MCIB but we need comprehensive reform and proper resourcing to bring it into line with the two equivalent accident investigative units.  The function of the MCIB is to examine and carry out investigations into all types of marine casualties to, or on board, Irish registered vessels worldwide and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways. Ireland’s maritime area is seven times the size of its landmass, with 7,500 km of coastline, not to mention our inland waterways. It is a vast area with complex and often dangerous vessel movements and we need a fully resourced investigative unit to match this.   Brexit has resulted in a huge increase in the number of direct shipping routes to the Continent, which is welcome. There are now 44 direct ferry routes between Ireland, France and the Benelux countries, up from just seven before Brexit. While thankfully we do not see many accidents in this area, it is a significant increase in the number of vessels, vehicles and personnel using our ports and taking longer journeys at sea, which will undoubtedly give rise to the potential for an increase in accidents. In addition, it is the State’s ambition to develop 5 GW of offshore wind power over the next decade. This will see a huge increase in activity at our ports and construction in our seas to build the offshore wind turbines. Again, this will result in a significant increase in vessel and personnel movements and more complex operations to install the turbines offshore. I am not suggesting this cannot be done safely but with such a major increase in activity in this area, it is absolutely appropriate to have a fully funded and adequately resourced maritime investigative unit to try to reduce the number of potential incidents and ensure that any accidents are investigated and learned from quickly.  The need for codification of marine law has also been highlighted previously but this Bill does not do that. The Bill refers to Merchant Shipping Acts going back as far as 1894. Some of this law was drafted before the State came into existence and when the merchant shipping fleet would have been largely sailing ships, not even steamships, not to mention the diesel ships that we have today. It is very difficult for stakeholders to untangle the complex web and find out what is required of them, which can only have a highly negative impact on compliance. It is clear this area is crying out for codification but the Government has said it will get back to it later as it needs to progress this particular Bill quickly.  In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Oireachtas committee stated that it welcomed the commencement of the Department’s review of our national marine investigation framework and looked forward to receiving a copy of the Clinch report as soon as possible. When will we see that report? We are very anxious to see it. The Minister of State referenced it in her opening remarks. It is important that committee members see it in advance of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill during which we will want to submit various amendments.   Sinn Féin recognises that this is important, technical legislation but as it is presented, it is a missed opportunity. It should have gone further and addressed the fundamental weaknesses, outside of the structural pieces, in the MCIB. We acknowledge that the Clinch report is complete and that we have a tentative commitment from the Government to consider legislation in the time ahead but we need to see more. We will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage that will enshrine that commitment in this legislation. I look forward to working with the Minister of State, members of the committee and other Members across this House to improve this legislation. It is necessary legislation and the measures provided thus far are necessary in terms of compliance with European law but we have a long way to go to deliver an investigative framework and system that is fit for purpose.

There is a maximum of 7.5 cent allowed per litre when diesel is greater than €1.43 per litre. Diesel is now at €1.70, as the Tánaiste likely knows, so the limit should be reviewed. We are encouraging hauliers to move towards compressed natural gas and that is not covered under the scheme. Will the Tánaiste commit to urgently reviewing the diesel rebate scheme? I fear that if it is not done, people will be driven out of business or into poverty.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-12-02 08:20:00+00:00	Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2021: Second Stage	1	Mandatory hotel quarantine is an important tool in our defence against the virus, particularly when the number of cases is low or, as is the case now, when dangerous variants break out. Sinn Féin will support this legislation and has tabled a number of amendments, as my colleague Deputy Cullinane outlined. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a concern and we must take appropriate measures in response. My party will support the reintroduction of mandatory hotel quarantine in exceptional circumstances for a limited period if expressly warranted by public health experts and officials, and we await that advice. Anyone who has listened to Dr. Mike Ryan or Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the WHO, or to the doctors and scientists in South Africa who identified the Omicron variant, will have heard that travel bans or restrictions are not the answer in and of themselves, although they might have a place, and nor is economic isolation. The answer, ultimately, is vaccination and public health measures.  In July, Dr. Mike Ryan described vaccine inequity throughout the world as an abomination. He stated:  We’ve developed highly effective vaccinations, and what’s our next move? To distribute them in an inequitable fashion so that we can stop the tragedy of the pandemic in some countries, and we will allow that pandemic to continue in so many others. It’s a tragedy and it’s an abomination that today there are frontline workers going to work in Covid wards in many countries that still have not been vaccinated. That is a disgrace. No one is safe until everyone is safe, and the Government and its leaders are complicit in their role. In recent days, the former President and the chair of the Elders, Mary Robinson, lent her voice to the same subject. She stated: The coronavirus pandemic is far from over. In the wake of the discovery of the Omicron variant and the risk it represents, the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) deadlock over a TRIPS intellectual property waiver on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments is simply unconscionable.  Epidemiologists warned us time and again that allowing the virus to spread around the world is a recipe for new mutations to develop and that they will indiscriminately harm us all. This waiver, which has now dominated WTO talks for over a year, is a necessary global solution to end the pandemic. Yet one powerful voice at the WTO has continued to undermine this effort ... The European Union represents the biggest roadblock to this effective solution to ramp up the supply of lifesaving vaccines, treatments and tests, hasten the end of the pandemic and put solidarity at the heart of the world’s response. The Government is complicit in this opposition to a TRIPS waiver. Former President Robinson wrote: By temporarily removing legal barriers preventing developing countries from producing billions of vaccines and treatments through qualified manufacturers, the waiver would suspend the monopoly control of pharmaceutical corporations, which guarantees them eye-watering profits while sacrificing lives. It would unlock the strong manufacturing capability and capacity that exists worldwide to upscale vaccine production, which is still being underutilized.  Led by South Africa and India, the initiative is already supported by over a hundred countries worldwide, not to mention over 175 former world leaders and Nobel Laurates, prominent jurists, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pope and millions of people. I have no doubt that millions of people in Ireland also support the initiative. Former President Robinson went on to state: United States President Joe Biden reiterated his support for a waiver just days ago, and has urged progress in response to the new variant. Yet the EU continues to meet this lifesaving proposal with intransigence.  It is shameful, disgraceful and disgusting. It must change.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-12-02 08:20:00+00:00	Finance Bill 2021: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage	1	I have a number of questions and concerns in relation to the provisions of this amendment, particularly as it relates to the price of fuel at the pump. Commuters and those involved in transport are seeing the price of petrol and diesel increasing at the forecourt every day. They are looking to the Government for some relief but they do not see it. Here we have a proposal to offset but as Deputy Doherty said, Sinn Féin had proposals in relation to carbon tax which the Government ignored. While carbon tax is not a huge element of the price increase, it is part of the increase that families are having to live with.  The argument made by the Government about the carbon tax is that it is ring-fenced for mitigation but the NORA levy is also ring-fenced for climate projects. In that context, what are the implications of this move for the ring-fenced element of the NORA levy which is supposed to be, on foot of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, a concession, and one of very few, on behalf of the Minister to the Opposition? What are the implications for those projects that are waiting for funding, including biodiversity and climate projects? Will they be impacted negatively by this measure and the reduction in the NORA levy?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-12-08 09:10:00+00:00	Offshore Renewable Energy: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I move amendment No. 1: To insert the following after “resources off our coast;”: “— involve the fishing industry at the pre-planning stage of any proposed offshore energy installations and ensure that support measures are put in place where necessary to protect the livelihoods of fishermen and the sustainability of the industry;” I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward the motion. Sinn Féin's amendment complements the motion and recognises the need to involve fishing communities in the development of offshore wind. I hope the amendment will be accepted.  Ireland has one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world, with a sea area approximately seven times the size of our landmass and a long-term potential for greater than 70 GW of ocean energy opportunity within 100 km of the Irish coastline. It is vital that this valuable natural resource is developed for the benefit of both our climate and our citizens. The Government must realise the potential of offshore wind and act on it in the interests of the people of Ireland, but it looks set to do neither. We hear from those at the coalface of this sector about the maritime planning Bill, delayed by a year; the marine area regulatory authority, delayed by at least a year; licences for surveys, impossible to get; interested parties looking elsewhere and going elsewhere; and a hydrogen strategy of which people ask, ""What is that?"" As for preparations at our ports, the Government says it is thinking about developing a plan and that it might get EU money. The Government's failure to deliver on its objectives today to meet its own targets is building in failures for the future, and future governments will be burdened by the Minister's incompetence. Those in the sector say we have a very limited window in which to get our house in order. Those with a keener eye say that the 5 GW offshore target for 2030 is already missed and that the Minister knows it. He dithers on floating offshore, he has failed to put in place the legislation and regulatory framework and, as a result, he denies the people of Ireland, particularly our fishing and coastal communities, the opportunity to benefit and to make the transition. Jobs are already being lost to England and elsewhere, we are told, and the truth is that the Minister knows nothing about a just transition. He is failing to realise this potential in the interests of the Irish people.  The people do not trust Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to deliver a good deal for the Irish people when it comes to our natural resources or anything else, for that matter. They will remember the Corrib, where the people got the scraps from the table. They are living with the national children's hospital and the details of the national broadband plan. A deal prepared by the same climate and communications Department that had expected to deliver for the Irish people on offshore wind is being laid bare in a day-by-day exposé in   One way in which the Government can ensure that our offshore potential is developed for the public good is for the State to lead from the front when it comes to investment and development in renewable energy and to be ambitious, bold and visionary on behalf of the Irish people. Semi-state companies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and others should be provided with the resources to develop and retain ownership of offshore wind projects and not just be bit-part players but be ambitious, bold and visionary. It is not a lot to ask but it seems to be too much to expect from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  There is a role for the private sector, for sure, but it is essential that the State does not become as reliant on private renewable energy companies for our future energy needs as we are currently reliant on private fossil fuel companies. We should not switch from one master to another. With offshore wind we have the opportunity for transformational social and economic change in our regions, coastal communities and urban and rural settings, but it has to be harnessed and managed. As of today, and as of the past 20 years, Irish governments are failing. The Minister should not take my word or Sinn Féin's word for it. He should look at the report of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, published just today. Marie Donnelly was on the radio this morning speaking about the implementation gap. It is there in lights. As for meeting targets, we are significantly off track, in the CCAC's words. Marie Donnelly was asked, if we do not change how we do things, whether we have a snowball's chance in hell of meeting our 2030 targets. She had a one-word answer: ""No"". I ask the Minister to heed this warning and to act. The CCAC report spelled out that this Government and previous governments have been all talk and no action. We need to deliver on the piece of this jigsaw of which the State is in control. There is huge opportunity for local communities, the Irish economy and the Irish people but it needs to be realised. I call on the Minister and his Government to heed the warnings."

On Sunday, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, said they potentially would be if they could show they had lost their job as a result of the latest restrictions, and there was reference to a Revenue or social welfare audit. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether taxi drivers will be included and, if so, how they will be assessed? Regarding the concept of losing one's job, we know 100% of late-night work is gone as well as at least 50% of other work. If the Department of Social Protection is so inclined, it can point towards the remaining work and say it is available to all taxi drivers to fight over. It is not enough to sustain them, however, especially over the Christmas period. Will the Taoiseach outline how the Government will support the taxi drivers over Christmas, which is a couple of weeks away?

They were told that a waiver on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, is essential. They told us the EU tactic is to use its counterproposal as a stalling tactic. This counterproposal focuses on existing provisions and compulsory licensing and does not go anywhere near far enough. Compulsory licensing only deals with the patent aspect of intellectual property, IP, and does not deal with trade secrets, data exclusivity or other overlapping layers. My party and others have been accused of virtue signalling about a TRIPS waiver, but nothing could be further from the truth. We can see the alternatives, such as COVAX, are not working. The Government has failed to support a TRIPS waiver but will the Government agree to meet with these academic and scientific experts, the People’s Vaccine Alliance, to hear their concerns?

The Bill commits to the establishment of a robust mandatory statutory register to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with building regulations within the building community and construction sector. Deputies Ó Broin and Gould have outlined Sinn Féin's concerns and the range of amendments that will be submitted, and those are important to note.  We can all agree we need a regime of registration, regulation, oversight and accountability that is fit for purpose, not just in construction but across the sector as a whole. In the couple of minutes I have I will focus on the national retrofitting programme, where the commitment from the Government is for 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps. It is a very significant undertaking. There is a question that must be asked, and it has been asked across the political spectrum in good faith. It is whether we can achieve the same emissions reductions, or perhaps even more, by taking a different approach because the scale of the challenge is incredible. There has been talk of the inverse care law and it applies in this area as well; the people who most need the retrofits are least able to afford it. We know from figures released to me in yesterday's parliamentary questions replies that just ten deep retrofits were carried out under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland scheme, with 1,730 carried out under the social housing scheme. It is a long way off 50,000 per year.  Since Christmas I have met people in sustainable energy communities across the country and they have raised legitimate concerns in good faith about the number of tradesmen and women available for this work. There is a serious shortage. There are also concerns about the skill sets as we are talking about relatively recent or new and emerging technologies. There is the example of the installation of heat pumps and the traditional skills do not apply. New skills are needed. There is also talk of dealing with tradesmen and women who are not familiar with the new technology.  I implore the Minister of State to ensure the opportunity can be grasped to increase capacity within those sectors and support sustainable energy communities. There should be increased opportunities with apprenticeships and people to deal with new technologies. Workers in the sector must be properly regulated, registered and overseen to ensure the highest standard and quality of work can be delivered so people can benefit from these retrofit programmes.

The Minister of State gave some details which seemed to contradict some of the information in the public domain. I ask the Minister of State why NBI's investors were permitted to fund the company through high-cost loans on which they will earn significant interest, instead of through the purchase of shares. It is reported that there was a €223 million investors' contribution and that it would be made by way of equity investment. In fact, it is reported that it was almost exclusively debt; some €221 million of debt. Those are the figures in the public domain. I ask the Minister of State whether they are accurate and what is the current state of affairs.

That is reported. I ask the Minister of State whether that is the case and if so, whether it runs contrary to the project information memorandum, which clearly states on page 110 that bidders had to foot their own costs.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-02 09:10:00+00:00	Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill 2022: First Stage	1	"I move: That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to require pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment suppliers and their servants or agents, to declare payments, gifts, donations or other transfers of values provided to healthcare professionals or health care organisations on an annual basis. I am happy to introduce the Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill with my colleagues, Deputies Cullinane and Seán Crowe. We know that payments to healthcare professionals and organisations can create conflicts of interest. Evidence shows that receipt of payments from the pharmaceutical industry, for example, is associated with higher prescribing rates, higher prescribing costs, increased use of specific drug classes, including opioids, and lower prescribing quality, with consequent impact on health outcomes and, in public health systems, on the public purse. The popular programme ""Dopesick"" highlighted an extreme case to great effect in the context of the opioid epidemic in the United States. In Ireland, tens of millions of euro are paid to healthcare professionals and organisations each year by the pharmaceutical industry. While a voluntary register of these payments is currently in place, recent research conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland found that the identity of many recipients is anonymous, while other payments may not be reported at all. Payments from medical equipment suppliers or medical device companies are also excluded.  The current voluntary system is inadequate. It is not fit for purpose. The Healthcare (Transparent Payments) Bill is needed to bring Ireland in line with international best practice and is a measure in the interest of professionals, organisations and the general public. This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment suppliers to declare all payments to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, on an annual basis and provides for penalties for failure to do so. The Bill also provides for the HPRA to establish and maintain the register and to ensure it is searchable and accessible to the public. Such a system will enhance transparency, public trust and ethical standards, while providing a regulated environment for productive collaboration. I commend the Bill to the House."

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. People are facing real hardship in their day-to-day lives with inflation and runaway living costs The Government has sat on its hands and allowed the cost-of-living crisis to grow, and indeed it has contributed to it. Rents have been spiralling out of control for years and the Government has done nothing. The Government has failed to address high childcare costs for parents and inflation is outpacing wage growth to no end. Each year the Government hikes tax on energy and then wonders why people are struggling to heat their homes. These policy failures are now coming together into a crippling cost-of-living crisis. The Government is completely out of touch with reality and is either unwilling or unable to take the necessary action to tackle the costs that are having a detrimental impact on workers and families across the State.  Of course the €100 electricity discount is welcome, but it will not make a dent in the financial challenge households are facing. It does not go far enough. Everyone knows that, including apparently the Government, if leaks from parliamentary party meetings in morning news reports are anything to go by. The Tánaiste acknowledged as much on Leaders' Questions earlier. Budget 2022 did not go far enough to protect people. The Government says it is making plans to do something about it. There has been talk from the Government to the effect of ""If we knew then what we know now"", but the truth is the Government did know then what it knows now because Sinn Féin and many others were shouting it from the rooftops. I raised it with the Minister of State three times in the previous term alone on Priority Questions, starting in July. Sinn Féin's alternative budget set out enhanced payments in social welfare, fuel allowance and a utility debt discretionary fund. The Government failed to heed any of it. The EU introduced its toolkit in October in recognition of the crisis and giving a green light to do something about it. Two months later, in the days before Christmas, the Government said it had a plan. Here we are on 3 February hoping that people might get grace to the value of €100 in a month or two. Families are in crisis and it is deepening one. When someone sounds the alarm in October you do not respond by saying I will see you in March or April. We know that inflation hits the poorest hardest and that the CSO's data are not reflective of this. We do not have accurate data on fuel poverty because this Government and that which preceded it failed to design measures for it. Anyone who bothers to listen knows that families have been put to the pin of their collars and beyond. They are in crisis and this Government knowingly delayed action. The €100 is welcome but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Much more needs to be done to help people. This Bill, if suitably amended, can act as a start, albeit a very late one.  We in Sinn Féin are not happy with the current draft of the Bill and we have submitted numerous amendments for consideration on Committee Stage. In the first instance, we are concerned that this Bill is drafted in such a way as to permit only one payment. That does not reflect the crisis we are in. A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done. There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon. With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year. Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly.  We also want to see the Minister target these payments to households who need it most. The lack of targeting is a major weakness. This Bill is a very blunt instrument that will see millions of euro transferred to individuals who, relatively speaking, have no financial worries. It will see millionaires and others who do not need financial help get €100 from the taxpayer, while those who really need extra help will, in real and relative terms, still be below the water. We would like to see provision for those who want to forgo the payment have the option of surrendering their payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty. It is far from an ideal approach, but it is an attempt to make this legislation better, by trying to direct payments to those most in need.  We believe holiday homes should be excluded. We cannot have a situation where a person who is lucky enough to own two homes gets €200 while a family living on the breadline can only access half that amount.  I welcome some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, but we believe protection is needed for renters in this Bill. Some tenants' energy bills are managed by their landlord or a property management company. We do not want to see a situation where the credit is applied to bills but the savings are not passed on to the tenant. Sinn Féin has put forward an amendment seeking to ensure the €100 payment is passed on to renters and providing for a right to access a dispute mechanism.  On a related point, I draw the Minister of State's attention to the issue of Travellers' access to the €100 credit. Will the Minister outline how this credit will apply to Travellers living on halting sites? The local authorities are the electricity account holder in many cases and families make payments to their local authorities. Perhaps the Minister of State will revert to me on that later.  Sinn Féin calls on the Minister of State to engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the level of need for assistance with heating and electricity costs it is experiencing to ascertain the need for a discretionary fund to assist those in utility debt and target those who need additional support most. We called for such a discretionary fund in budget 2022 in addition to proposing to allocate €30 million to extend the fuel allowance eligibility. Like other positive proposals, however, it was not taken on board.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate. I encourage the Minister of State and Department to take on board Opposition proposals. There is an opportunity to improve on the legislation. Sinn Féin will put forward constructive amendments, as will others in the Opposition. The Minister of State and Department should take them on board."

I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Bill, along with my colleagues Deputies Réada Cronin, Johnny Guirke and Maurice Quinlivan. Hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources through electrolysis of water is emerging as a sustainable solution for the decarbonisation of many sectors. It has, for example, the potential to act as a store of surplus renewable energy, an alternative source of heat for homes and businesses and an alternative source of fuel in the transport sector, including for long-haul and heavy goods vehicles, HGVs. In the words of Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, in response to me in a recent Oireachtas committee meeting, there is a lot of talk about hydrogen at the moment but perhaps not enough strategic planning around it. We need a plan and we need to get the picture on the page so that we can see what it looks like. This Bill calls on the Minister to publish a green hydrogen strategy within six months of its passing and sets out the framework for that strategy. It is an important and necessary step.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-09 09:10:00+00:00	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	1	I move amendment No. 3: In page 4, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following: “(e) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to identify those who own holiday homes or multiple properties and put in place a mechanism to ensure such individuals do not receive more than one electricity costs emergency benefit payments. (f) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to identify those who are renting, to ensure renters receive the benefit of the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, and the Minister shall put in place a dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any disputes between renters and their landlords or property management companies over the electricity costs emergency benefit payment. (g) The Minister shall make provision in the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme to ensure those who do not need the financial support from the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, can inform their electricity supplier to redirect their electricity costs emergency benefit payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty.”. I will speak to the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Pearse Doherty. The amendment seeks to address a number of weaknesses in the Bill. A number of amendments that were ruled out of order for various reasons also sought to improve the legislation.  This amendment seeks to deal with three issues, the first of which is the prospect of the payment being made to people who have holiday homes with potentially very little electricity use. These houses would only be used for some weeks of the year. The amendment also applies to people with multiple properties who would be in a position to receive multiple payments for their properties. At the very least, such situations do not reflect their electricity or energy use and the cost to them of electricity. This anomaly should be addressed, especially when considered in the context of the potential risk that people who are house sharing and splitting bills or whose names are not on the bill will miss out on this payment. Paragraph (f) of the amendment provides that renters would receive the benefit of the payment.  We call for a dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place. The Minister, in his Second Stage speech, indicated that such a provision will be made. When this payment is triggered, which is not happening nearly quickly enough, we need to ensure that those who are entitled to it get the benefit of it.  Paragraph (g) addresses a fundamental weakness of the measure, namely, its universal nature. It is not targeted. While the Government has made its case on that, it is a fundamental weakness. Despite other measures the Government has introduced, many people will still be below the waterline, even with this €100 payment. We are incredibly frustrated that the Government did not go further or take action earlier and that it has taken this long to reach this juncture. We set out in our pre-budget submission, and will set out in the days ahead, the course the Government should take. A fundamental part of that is a response that is reflective of the burden on individuals and families. We do not see that in the legislation. Paragraph (g) gives all those who do not need this support, including every Member of this House, an opportunity to forgo the payment and redirect towards charities working in the area of energy poverty.  The amendment would strengthen the Bill. Of the 11 amendments we submitted, ten have been ruled out of order. They also would have strengthened the Bill. I ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to support the amendment and take on board the contributions made on Second Stage by Deputies from across the political spectrum, particularly the Opposition, pointing out the weakness of this Bill. I appreciate that there are constraints on the Government with regard to the targeting of this measure but those constraints were self-inflicted by the Government. It has not done the work over the years to identify those living in energy poverty and at risk of energy poverty. There is no sophistication in the architecture of the State, including Department, to direct those resources in the way they should be directed. This is down to a lack of preparation.  The Government has indicated it will make proposals which, while not a mini-budget, will address the costs of living. I ask that the weaknesses of the Bill be addressed in the suite of measures that are brought forward. Sinn Féin would be more than happy to advise in that regard.

It is a motion about inclusion and ensuring the right to mobility and the associated independence for people with disabilities, and ensuring that people with disabilities can live full and active lives in our communities. The motion is welcome and necessary, and it should be supported. Government policy under successive governments has failed to deliver. It has failed people with disabilities and impeded them.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, we heard from representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind about the forthcoming road traffic Bill and about broader issues relating to access to transport. The witnesses spoke about the importance of the primary medical certificate. They pointed to the fact that the mobility allowance and the transport grant were stopped nearly a decade ago and have not returned. They pointed to the broad suite of issues that continue to impede. On the primary medical certificate they said: ""A review is required of the primary medical certificate. It is as simple as that. The sooner it can get under way, the better.""  They also argued that the certificate should be extended to include people with intellectual disabilities or autism, people who in the severe category will definitely never hold independent employment. They said: ""They definitely need preferential parking for ease of access for their carers and themselves"". Similarly, they pointed to the fact that blindness is not regarded as a qualifying criterion for the primary medical certificate, so a review of that is required. In addition, they pointed to the cases of people who are too visually impaired to drive but are not registered as blind and, as a result, are excluded from free travel. That speaks to the failure of Government policy to respond to the needs of people with disabilities. There are hundreds of people in this category but, like for so many people with a disability, the computer says ""No"". There is no accommodation, understanding or common sense in the current systems and, as a result, people are excluded, disadvantaged and isolated. The primary medical certificate is only one aspect of this issue. We need to replace the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant. We need universal design of buses, trains, taxis and associated infrastructure. We need public transport in the right place and at the right time that is accessible, available and affordable. The same goes for streetscapes. We need a full suite of supports to empower people and ensure they can travel independently. It should not be an afterthought, as it is, at best, in many cases currently. Rather, it should be built into everything we do - literally and figuratively."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-17 09:00:00+00:00	National Retrofitting Scheme: Statements	1	"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the recently launched national retrofit plan. The plan restates the 2019 Climate Action Plan target of 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps by 2030. It directs a majority of State supports to those with private means. Delivery since 2019 has been miserably slow. The Government's new, redesigned programme recognises something we have been saying for years, that the deep retrofitting scheme is way out of the financial reach of most individuals and families. The Government refused to accept or acknowledge this, but the figures do not lie. A parliamentary reply I received last month showed that just ten private deep retrofits were completed last year, not 10,000 or 50,000 as is needed each year.  Now, the Government has recognised that its original plan was failing and has sought to change course. While some of these new changes are welcome, others are not. I welcome the fact the SEAI’s ""no second visit"" rule has been removed. That was an unnecessary barrier that prevented many households making incremental improvements to their homes, as their financial means allowed. I also welcome the attic and cavity wall insulation programme. This is something we had raised, albeit in a slightly different way, by saying people should be supported carrying out lesser works such as replacing windows and doors, as we recognised most people cannot afford major works.  While these two aspects are welcome, the national retrofit plan as announced has significant and major flaws. The programme, as designed, will not direct sufficient resources and support to those most in need. Instead it disproportionately advantages those with means, with cash at hand or with the ability to pay back a medium-term loan. This is a massive transfer of wealth. Working families who earn too much for the warmer homes scheme but do not earn enough to afford major improvements will have the choice of taking on considerable levels of debt or continuing to live in a cold house. The plan is silent on renters, both on improving the energy efficiency of their homes to try to reduce their bills, and on the protections needed to ensure they are not evicted by unscrupulous landlords using retrofitting as a cover. It fails to address how the huge backlog on the warmer homes scheme will be tackled with appropriate haste.  In terms of the transfer of wealth, it is very clear that this plan significantly benefits those with means and prioritises ability to pay over need. Those who have the means can now get €50,000 worth of work done to their home and only have to pay half of that, with the taxpayer coughing up €25,000. Is it equitable that the taxpayer should be funding the retrofitting of a millionaire’s home, for example? I do not think so. Taxpayer-funded grants should be targeted to provide financial assistance to those who really need help paying for energy upgrades. There is no income cap or sliding scale, and for what return? What reduction in emissions? With the one-stop shop scheme we have a very likely scenario that much of our better housing stock will be retrofitted first. Retrofitting will not take place in order of need, BER or income. An income cap and a sliding scale of grants would have been more appropriate. They would target financial support at those who need it. A parliamentary reply I received yesterday stated that ""imposing new additional income limits and means testing were not considered as part of the design of the new upgrade scheme."" They were not even considered. The Minister might clarify if and why this was the case.  For most working families who do not have €10,000, €20,000 or €25,000 available to them to carry out a deep retrofit under the 50% scheme, they have three choices. They can take on considerable debt via the new loan scheme, although many are simply not in a position to do this. They can tip-toe along on the up to 80% scheme but this is limited. We will have a scenario where Mary and Tom living in number 25, working hard on a low income and can only get shallow work done on their BER G rated house. Around the corner in number 30 Máire and Tomás, working hard on a middle or high income, have a BER C rating and a warmer home, and they can afford to get a deep retrofit. The third option is to continue living in cold, damp houses.  The level of funding for the plan is welcome. It does not match Sinn Féin’s commitment but with it, the Government had options. If it had opted for a sliding scale of grants, less money would be granted to those who do not need the same financial help, freeing up additional resources that could be allocated for working families on lower incomes. In a time of rising energy costs, it is a major disappointment that this plan is so weak in this regard. It does not sufficiently direct the resource to areas of most need. It fails those on lower incomes. It fails the equity test. There is no other way to say it. Social Justice Ireland agrees with me in this regard.  It fails renters, too. Some 25% of the population are renting. Most are paying high rents, often for substandard accommodation. I was very disappointed but not surprised to see they were forgotten about entirely. Many tenants are living in poor quality homes and apartments. Despite charging exorbitant rents, many landlords will not invest in energy efficiency, leaving tenants with massive heating bills each month. They talk about the so-called split incentive; the landlord does not pay the ESB bill and does not get the benefit of retrofitting, so why would he or she retrofit? The split incentive is a red-herring, a misnomer. Government has the means to push or entice landlords to retrofit. It can introduce mandatory standards, for example, but it will not and will only hint that something might be done after 2025, when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party may be out of government.   In respect of those landlords who want to use retrofitting or home improvement works as a means to change tenants, there is no additional protection for renters from eviction. When I look at the scheme presented by the Government, I predict most renters will go on living in cold homes while others face the prospect of their landlord using retrofitting as an excuse to evict them. The national retrofit plan can be added to long list of ways this Government has failed renters. The new plan also seeks to continue the warmer homes scheme, now the free energy upgrade scheme. This scheme provides full retrofits for those on the lowest incomes and elderly homeowners. The eligibility criteria have been slightly expanded to those on disability allowance. However, the scheme is being massively restricted on the other hand from pre-2006 builds to pre-1993 builds. This is a massive restriction. It has not received much attention but it surely will when people go to apply for these supports. In addition, there is an incredible 26-month average waiting time from application date to works completed. That is the average; it is far longer in many areas. There are over 7,000 on the list. The Government says it will complete in the region of 5,000 this year. That is a big commitment far beyond anything that has ever been achieved, but it still leaves 2,000 waiting as well as anyone who applies this year. I hope many will apply but perhaps the 1993 restriction will put paid to that prospect.  How the Government intends to address these backlogs and long waiting times is not at all clear. We do not have enough tradesmen and women and we have even fewer who are suitably trained. There is the real prospect that the expansion of other schemes such as the one-stop shop scheme will only increase competition for contractors and could result in these waits getting even longer.  Those who are eligible for the warmer homes or free energy upgrade scheme are the most vulnerable to energy poverty. These are people on the lowest incomes, elderly people living in cold homes, people on social welfare payments who have to choose between food and fuel. These people should have been prioritised, but it seems they could actually fall down the queue due to the structure of this plan.   The national retrofit plan aims to invest €8 billion of taxpayer’s money. For a plan with such a massive budget, the Government has provided very little background information for critical analysis. There are very serious questions that need to be answered. Are we getting bang for our buck? What emissions reductions will we achieve? Are we targeting State resources in the best way?  Important information examining the assessment of this policy and other climate policies is not being published or shared with Members. For example, in 2021 the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications spent €924,525 of public money on reports, economic analysis and modelling from McKinsey. I believe McKinsey is driving Government thinking on climate policy - even more so than the Climate Change Advisory Council - but, unlike the council, its proposals are hidden. I believe that to be the case for climate action plans for both 2019 and 2021. We have asked to see the content of those reports but the Government is refusing to share it with us. There is a host of unanswered questions in this area. It is simply not good enough.   We need a national retrofitting programme. We need it to improve the fabric of people’s homes and the quality of their health and lives and to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels for heat. The scale of the Government’s ambition is significant, even if it does not match Sinn Féin’s. We differ - it is a significant difference - on how we fund it and how the programme is targeted. The Government’s programme fails the equity test in its funding and design. It will fail the equity test in its delivery."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-22 14:00:00+00:00	Citizens' Assemblies: Motion	1	I welcome the commitment to a citizens' assembly on the biodiversity crisis. Campaigners have been calling for the assembly to be convened as a matter of priority to address the growing biodiversity crisis that has been caused by habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change. These factors have caused a rapid acceleration of animals and plants becoming extinct. Measures to restore biodiversity could have a significant impact if implemented properly.  The State's record is not good. For example, almost half of Irish rivers have unsatisfactory water quality levels. We will plan for development in our oceans without identifying marine protected areas. Derrybrien wind farm was built in breach of environmental regulations and is now in legal limbo having been refused retrospective planning consent. It has already cost the State €17 million in European Commission fines, with the total rising to €15,000 a day as its status remains unresolved.  Last week it was reported on the back of freedom of information data obtained by my colleague, Senator Boylan, that the OPW was investigated for breaches of wildlife regulations over refurbishment works that threatened a protected bat. The OPW was advised of this but ignored the advice and carried on regardless. We hear similar stories on a daily basis.  The 2019 global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services warned that an unprecedented loss of species will continue to gain pace unless countries take urgent action to tackle it. The citizens' assembly is a step in the right direction but it needs to move to action. When we have it, we should heed its findings. It cannot be tokenism, greenwashing or a fudge.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-22 14:00:00+00:00	Carbon Tax: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I will deal with the issue of the carbon tax as a mechanism for delivering on our climate obligations. Listening to Government spokespersons, we would be led to believe that the carbon tax is the be-all and end-all; no carbon tax, no climate action. However, we have had carbon taxes for 13 years now and emissions have increased year on year. Sinn Féin is firmly of the opinion that tinkering with markets or creating new ones will not deliver the type of systemic change that is needed.  The Government will say that in Ireland the carbon tax is ring-fenced for climate action but that is not really true. In 2021, €652 million was raised in carbon taxes while just €130 million was ring-fenced. Some €77 million of that was for residential and community energy efficiency, about 50% of which is going to retrofit the homes of the better off. It also included €15 million for the agriculture programme which is not being spent yet. There was €37 million spent on social protection but that is not climate action, it is climate mitigation, giving people money to buy fossil fuels because the Government is increasing the price of fossil fuels. Out of every €100 raised in carbon taxes, about €14 is going on actual climate action.  The Government will say carbon taxes are redistributed to protect those on the lowest incomes. In saying this, it very selectively cites an ESRI report from 2020. In fact, the calculations in that report are based solely on increases in carbon tax, nothing beyond that. They do not, for example, take the increased price of oil and gas on the international markets into account. The report does not support the Government's claim. The Government will also say it is a long-term commitment over ten years that will raise €9.5 billion for climate. That is very questionable. Just today at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action we had a response to our reasoned opinion on the EU's Fit for 55 package. The Commission remains absolutely intent on introducing a new emissions trading system for fuels used in transport and buildings. That would equate to around 80% of carbon tax revenue possibly lost. We cannot and should not depend on carbon tax to deliver climate action. The evidence shows it does not work. In the context of rising energy costs and a failure to provide an alternative, it is punitive and unfair.

We have articulated the position repeatedly over recent months and days. I am disappointed that our amendments have been ruled out of order, but so be it. I am more disappointed that the Minister did not table similar amendments. We firmly believe that now is the opportunity to get the area of marine casualty investigations right. There is a long and sorry history of missed opportunities, whether it be in the 1998 report, the 2010 Róisín Lacey report, or the 2020 Clinch report. We have the Róisín Lacey report. It explains clearly what needed and needs to be done. Instead, the State defended the indefensible at a European court and, as expected, failed.  We have deep concerns about the fact the Bill does not go further. As I said on Committee Stage, we hear the commitments from the Minister to publish the Clinch report at the end of the first quarter. There is a big question mark over that. It is subject to approval by the Attorney General. There is a further commitment to deliver the substantive legislation that has been called for across the political spectrum. Again, there is a huge question mark over that in its being subject to approval by Cabinet.  There are clear weaknesses in marine casualty investigation in Ireland. This was the legislation that could have resolved it. We had 18 months to get it right but the Minister has not got it right and has not taken the opportunity to give cast-iron guarantees in this legislation that, within a given timeframe, he would deliver the necessary reforms. In that context, we cannot support the Bill.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-02 09:10:00+00:00	National Driver Licence Service: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion and I thank Deputy McNamara and the Independent Group for tabling it. Sinn Féin supports the motion, which raises some very important issues, particularly as they relate to inclusivity, State procurement and State priorities.  Two weeks ago, in a response to a parliamentary question I tabled, and again today, the Minister has confirmed that the current NDLS contract, which was put in place with the front-office service provider in June 2021, no longer offers a walk-in service. Appointments must be booked to attend an NDLS centre and are made available through the online booking system or by telephone. The fact is that the current system is failing people. I will share with the House the experience of one constituent of mine who went to his local NDLS centre on 8 February. He arrived for an appointment only to realise that he had not received an email - he does not have email - or a text confirmation so had no appointment. The centre was empty, however, so he immediately rang 0818 919 090. He received no response. He dialled 1 - no response. He dialled 9 - no response. The official behind the desk told him he was wasting his time. He went home. He tried to reach the service on that number for 20 minutes on each of the next four days. He received no response. On day five he waited 101 minutes before his call was answered.  To add insult to injury, this service has been outsourced to a private company with a limited footprint, 34 offices, at a time when this Government and that which preceded it have known full well that An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union are crying out for this type of contract to ensure their future viability. If they were before us today, they would say that they want more Government services and footfall, particularly any work that requires ID verification. They already do that work for the Department of Social Protection. In hundreds of post offices they already have ID verification equipment and systems and, at the drop of a hat, they could have such equipment in every single office if that was what was required.  The truth, however, is that the post office network is hanging in the balance, and successive Governments have continued to turn their backs on the network. This is despite the fact that the 2016 Kerr report on the future of the post office network, on page 41, highlighted specifically that the provision of driver licences should be considered as part of an increase in the range of Government services available through the post office network.  In March of last year, the Government set up an offline services group to identify suitable services based on the recommendations of the offline services report and to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to post offices. We were told that this group, in conducting its work, was considering the increased use of the post office network for the delivery of Government services. On 7 July of last year, during a Dáil debate on the post office network, the Minister of State said: ""The Government's objectives for An Post include harnessing the opportunities presented by e-commerce and the digital economy, capturing and retaining market share in parcels and delivering a sustainable nationwide post office network offering a range of e-commerce, financial and Government services."" I stress the phrase ""and Government services"". What has come of all that? What Government services have been or will be transferred to An Post since these groups and objectives were identified? What has come of the Government's explorations and examinations? Following report after report, nothing has come of this from the perspective of An Post. There are comforting words from the Government but, when it comes to it, when there are clear options on the table, An Post loses out. There might be some small defence if the Government said it was delivering a better service at a cheaper rate, but the exact opposite is true in the case of the driver licence service.  To add further insult to further injury, as for the online service, the Government looks set to throw good money after bad in defence of the PSC. That is what I expect the Government will do, as other Deputies have said, if it does not remove the PSC requirement. To be clear, the objective is to drive people online, and it is 100% mandatory to have a PSC to avail of services online. That is belligerence. The Government needs to act on this and remove that element."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-02 09:10:00+00:00	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022: From the Seanad	1	We will not oppose either amendment. This is one occasion where we welcome the Government amendments. Sinn Féin had put forward a series of amendments on both Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil that, I firmly believe, would have given the Government greater flexibility regarding the upper limits and would have meant we would not need primary legislation if we were to return to similar circumstances in the near, or even not-so-near, future.  I have had a series of meetings in recent days with representatives of energy suppliers. They are very concerned with the current state of affairs and, obviously, everything happening in Ukraine impacts on that. Of course, energy costs are not our primary consideration in that regard, but increases are likely to be a very real consequence. We are, quite possibly, facing into a summer and winter this year that will realise the same types of energy cost increases that we saw last year, and that will put families beyond the pin of their collar. It will drive families into energy and fuel poverty, and into poverty in general, and I expect we will again end up in this position, needing the Government to deliver a significant package of support.  At this point, the proposals from the Government do not go far enough, although the provisions in the legislation are welcome. The Government has constrained itself through how it has framed the legislation, and the Sinn Féin amendments would have given the Government more flexibility. Regrettably, I firmly believe we will be back here again, on our part calling on the Government to do more and presenting alternative options to the Government to do more to protect families from the impact of rising fuel and energy costs. I do not say with any degree of satisfaction that what we are facing into in the months ahead is deeply concerning. As I said, I have met stakeholders from across the spectrum. They say they are weeks away from significant price hikes and they are looking towards the back end of the year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows this well and I am sure he has been having similar conversations. He has heard our criticism of the legislation but we will nonetheless support it. I implore the Government to see the writing on the wall, look to the months ahead and the summer and the winter, and get its act together by coming back with a substantial proposal to mitigate the impacts these unfortunate and regrettable increases will have on families.

Energia, SSE Airtricity and the ESB are three examples. It is reported ESB will report record profits of €679 million for 2021, up 10% on 2020. To give some perspective, the Government's cost-of-living package was €505 million.  The European Commission is very clear and it has spelt out how governments can, and should, assess and tackle excessive crisis-related windfall profits. Does the Government believe these profits at ESB and elsewhere are excessive? How is the matter being assessed? Is the Government considering introducing a windfall tax?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-09 09:10:00+00:00	Financial Resolution: Excise	1	This Government response is totally inadequate and insufficient. In the short time I have available to me, I want to make the case on behalf of the transport and logistics sector, the sector that keeps supply lines open and people and goods moving. It includes hauliers, private coach operators, school bus operators, coach tourism operators and taxi drivers. Businesses from the four corners of the State have been in contact with me in recent days crying out for support. A haulier in my county who has been drawing fresh food and vegetables for more than 25 years says he will finish up at the end of this week because fuel is beyond €1.70 per litre plus VAT, with promises of further increases. He uses 78,000 l per month but bases his prices on a cost of 95 cent per litre plus VAT. He cannot take it. He cannot pass the cost on to his customers and has no fuel surcharge. If more is not done on diesel prices, he will go to the wall. His business is family run and has 25 lorries and 40 employees.  Similarly, as of this week, a school bus operator in north Dublin is running at a loss. He signed a five-year contract with Bus Éireann in 2018 based on a cost of €1.37 per litre. Prices are now beyond €1.70 per litre plus VAT, with a 45 cent increase in one week alone. The operator says it is totally unsustainable and that the problem has come just when things were looking up after Covid.  In coach tourism, a contractor in Tipperary–Kilkenny signed contracts 18 to 24 months ago based on a rate of €1.29 per litre, allowing for an increase of 10 cent or 15 cent. Now, as we know, prices are in excess of €2 per litre, yet the Government is proposing to take just 15 cent off diesel. It went up 22 cent on the wholesale market yesterday. At best, the Government will bring diesel prices back to those of last Friday evening or Saturday morning. The businesses I have referred to are proud family businesses that provide employment in the four corners of Ireland. They are keeping Ireland moving but this is how they are treated. It is an absolute disgrace. To be clear about it, the Government is doing more on petrol than on diesel. The companies provide essential services. They run on diesel and do not have alternatives.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-30 09:10:00+01:00	Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	Today's globalised economy is overwhelmingly based on a linear model of production and consumption. We take, make and then waste. The environmental impact of a linear throwaway model in which we extract great quantities of natural resources to make things we may only use once before disposing of them is not sustainable. It is estimated the raw material resources we use in a year is already 50% more than nature can replenish in a year. On present trends, this will rise to a factor of three by 2050. The circular economy offers an alternative, whereby waste and resource use is minimised and the value of products and materials is maintained as long as possible.  Getting items repaired instead of binning them and remanufacturing items by taking them apart and using parts again in new items has the potential to decrease the amount of primary resource extraction and reduce the carbon impact of manufacturing and transporting single-use items. We need to start thinking and acting in new ways. Our planet simply demands it. As a result, Sinn Féin welcomes most aspects of the Bill. What is unusual about the Bill is that the circular economy is not pioneering or anything new. It tries to recreate what happened in days gone by. Years ago, very little food was thrown away in homes. People mended the soles of their shoes, sewed torn clothes and passed them down, and repaired broken household items. Modern day consumerism has fuelled a damaging throwaway approach, resulting in huge, almost unimaginable, amounts of waste, something the Bill and a national strategy now seek to reverse.  All of the responsibility to change this approach cannot be placed at the feet of workers and families. The corporations that have profited hugely from this throwaway model need to be tackled and forced to take appropriate action to change their behaviour. Last year I travelled to COP26 in Glasgow and highlighted the irony of the CEO of Amazon speaking at a major climate change conference when, just weeks earlier, a few miles up the road from Glasgow, the company he heads was found to be destroying millions of items of unsold stock every year, including smart televisions, laptops, drones and hairdryers, simply to ensure the excess did not impact on its profits. It was a disgusting display of greed and waste. While disposable cups might be the headline for the media today, there is no point charging consumers for using a coffee cup if such disgraceful behaviour by major corporations is not challenged and addressed by the Government and regulators.  The Bill seeks to give the Minister the power to introduce new environmental levies on single-use items and, in the longer term, to prohibit placing on the market of certain environmentally harmful products. A total of 91% of all plastics are single use and the rate of mass production since plastic became commonly used almost six decades ago has resulted in 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic pollution. Single-use plastics are a scourge on our environment, with a vast amount ending up in our oceans and having a major impact on our marine ecosystems. It was amazing to see the speed at which industries could abandon some single-use plastics and move to a more sustainable model when they had to under the EU single-use plastic directive that came into force last year. It is a shame it took so long to address this, in addition to microplastics, with so much ending up in landfill and our oceans.  Officials from the Department raised the prospect of applying a levy on all classes of coffee cups, including plastic and biodegradable, to discourage the single-use approach and promote reusable alternatives. Will the Minister of State give an update on what approach he intends to take in this area? As he is aware, at the beginning of this year France banned the sale of certain fruit and vegetables that came wrapped in unnecessary plastic. If we walk down the fruit and vegetable aisle of any supermarket in Ireland, the amount of needless plastic wrapping we see on some food is astonishing. Such a ban is not included in the Bill. I asked a parliamentary question on whether the Minister intends to follow the French example. He indicated he was not planning to introduce a similar ban here as our supply chain is different from that of France and such a proposal would need to be examined further. Has further consideration being given to this? The amount of plastic wrapping we see is quite incredible. There is a plastic sticker on every individual apple or orange or whatever it might be.  On a related matter, one of the topics my colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, raised during pre-legislative scrutiny was the standard of biodegradable packaging and the importance of ensuring we simply do not replace single-use plastics with single-use biodegradable containers that have questionable content, for example, PFAS. The environmental charity, VOICE Ireland, gave evidence during pre-legislative scrutiny that a compost bowl obtained in the Oireachtas canteen was the highest rated for PFAS, with 12 times the allowable amount of that chemical coating on the bowl. These chemicals touch people's food, and when the container is composted, they can end up back in a farmer's field and in the food chain. Recently, Denmark and California banned PFAS in food contact material. Has the Minister of State given consideration to this?  I welcome the proposal in the Bill to draft a national food waste prevention strategy. Despite the horrendous level of world hunger, more than one quarter of food produced worldwide is wasted. In Ireland, people have become more conscientious about food waste in recent years. The arrival of food waste prevention apps that allow people to buy excess food from shops and bakeries for a discount highlights the positive role that technology can play in fighting food waste. During pre-legislative scrutiny, I raised the issue of the need for mandatory reporting by food businesses of the amount of food waste they generate and the actions taken to reduce such waste. Under the provisions of the Bill and the strategy, we have to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030. It is arguable that a mandatory 7% food waste reduction target should be set each year with appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure we can meet this target. Will the Minister of State outline what consideration has been given to this mandatory approach?  On the deposit return scheme, while the details of the proposed scheme are not included in the Bill, it forms a key part of the circular economy approach. Last year, regulations were signed by the Minister for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles and aluminium cans. This is supposed to come into effect later this year. While this is welcome and long overdue, Sinn Féin is strongly of the opinion that glass should be included in any new scheme. A recommendation from pre-legislative scrutiny similarly noted that, as glass is an acceptable material for deposit return and for the development of collection, cleaning and refilling infrastructure, consideration should be given to including glass containers in any future expansion of a deposit return scheme. Perhaps it is something the Minister of State might touch on in his closing remarks.  We welcome the new provisions that will allow local authorities to use CCTV and drones in a proportional manner to combat illegal dumping. It is an absolute scourge. I want to raise some questions on the Minister of State's engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. I expect we will have an opportunity to tease out those details on Committee Stage. There is a fine line here and it is important to get the balance right with regard to the use of this technology. It will require close scrutiny.  On the circular economy fund, will the Minister of State outline how much will be in the environment fund? What is the estimated annual income of this new circular economy fund? Will he provide detail on the activities to be financed by that new fund?  I will touch on a further point raised during prelegislative scrutiny, which has regard to repair shops. We heard from various witnesses who had tried to do their very best with repair shops. They told us of the barriers, hurdles and impediments they faced, one of which was the issue of VAT and insurance. Has the Minister of State engaged with the Minister for Finance on these matters?  We welcome the Bill. There is a very significant amount in it. How it impacts on the worst offenders, including businesses and corporations, will be important. It cannot just be left to individuals. We are happy to work with the Minister of State, who I know has taken a significant personal interest in and responsibility for bringing the Bill forward. I look forward to working with him on Committee Stage and further stages.

After two brutal years of Covid, taxi drivers are at the pin of their collar. They need support or they will go to the wall. They need more action on fuel costs.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-06 09:50:00+01:00	Carbon Budget: Motion	1	I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Murchú, Patricia Ryan and Martin Browne.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. The carbon budgets were proposed by the independent CCAC and, after detailed scrutiny and engagement with stakeholders, were recommended for adoption by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, though not unanimously. The advisory council’s evidence at the committee hearings was clear: we need immediate and urgent action, a whole-of-government approach and a complete reorientation and reprioritisation to ensure we can make the necessary changes now to help meet our targets in the years ahead. We heard from other experts who said the budgets do not go far enough, and that cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, what I took from the totality of the evidence and the deliberations, and I believe ours is a committee that is serious about its work, was that we do not have the luxury of more time. The time for talking on climate has passed; radical action is needed now. These carbon budgets are the advisory council’s best estimate and, if implemented, can deliver the 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  We in Sinn Féin are in no doubt about the scale of the climate crisis facing the world and, in line with our support for our 2030 and 2050 targets, we will vote to approve these carbon budgets as proposed by the advisory council, although the third budget should be subject to further discussion. While we agree with the ambition and the targets, we disagree fundamentally with many of the policy decisions the Government is implementing. We will continue to bring forward constructive alternatives that we believe will help us meet our targets in a fair and just way.  This debate on carbon budgets is timely, given the major report published on Monday by the UN's IPCC. The contents of the report are incontrovertible and the consequences of failing to act unimaginable. It can leave us in no doubt that it is now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. We are on track for an increase exceeding 3°C, with devastating consequences for the globe. We know what needs to be done and how to do it, and we now need the Government to lead and deliver the just transition that will reduce emissions and secure a liveable future, and not just talk about it.  The reduction in emissions set out in these budgets will be very challenging to achieve. This challenge has been made all the greater as a result of the failure to act in years gone by. It is precisely because successive Governments ignored repeated climate warnings from scientists and permitted our carbon emissions to accelerate over the past 20 years that we have been left scrambling to make radical changes now. Incoherent policies have also contributed to the challenges we now face in energy, transport, housing and elsewhere. While public transport is rightly encouraged, many areas across the State remain without real options. The investment was not made. Major public transport projects such as MetroLink or the Navan rail line have been repeatedly kicked down the road and remain undelivered, leaving these communities without sustainable transport modes. In my constituency this week, a lifeline public transport route, the 136, used by elderly people to get to and from the shops once a week is being pulled. That is public transport in Ireland in 2022.  At the same time, the red carpet was rolled out for energy-hungry data centres with no regard for our electricity generation capacity or the impact the policy would have on our national emissions. Similarly, successive governments gave us and championed a system of developer-led development. Communities got houses, houses, houses and urban sprawl. It was the opposite of compact growth or transport-led development. It created dependency on cars. There were no amenities, public parks or green spaces, and creaking infrastructure.  Ratoath in my constituency is one example. The water infrastructure in that town is crumbling under increased pressure from the growing population, leading to frequent water outages which impact on businesses, families, young and old and people with disabilities. As the town grew and developers and the local authority made money, citizens were and are being failed by the lack of timely investment in water infrastructure. There is a plan involving the Windmill Hill reservoir and trunk water main, but the work is too slow and outages far too frequent. I implore the Minister of State to contact the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to have that work expedited. It is an example of much talk but little action.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report highlights that in order to limit global warming, major change in the energy sector will be required. Thankfully, we have the tools and know-how, but now we need a focus on rapid delivery. Ireland is uniquely placed to become a world leader in offshore wind and reduce our emissions significantly, but we have heard from the wind industry that our 2030 renewable target is already in doubt. The Oireachtas climate committee in recent weeks heard that we have just a 50/50 chance of meeting our 2030 target of 5 GWs of offshore wind. This is at a time when the head of the EPA says we can expect emissions here to increase in 2022. They need to decrease by 4.8% to meet the carbon budgets.  We heard that we need greater numbers of personnel in the planning authorities like An Bord Pleanála and that we need to ensure our offshore planning processes are as speedy as possible. We heard we need investment in BirdWatch Ireland and other prescribed bodies to ensure planning is done in a sustainable way. We need updated and new regulations brought forward and investment in grid infrastructure. EirGrid is not fit for purpose. We need our ports to be developed to ensure we can build and maintain the turbines and develop the supply chain industry here. We should designate those ports today.  Green hydrogen goes hand in hand with offshore wind and offers the State huge potential for the export of this green energy to Europe. I brought forward a Bill seeking to develop a national green hydrogen strategy as soon as possible. We should strive to become a world leader in this field, and I hope the Minister of State acts on this soon.  In relation to onshore wind, we are still awaiting updated regulations, with the outdated ones having contributed to numerous development problems in the past. The delay in bringing this forward is unacceptable, and the industry says the same. If lessons are not learned from bad developments like Derrybrien, then we will not deliver the necessary onshore wind in the time ahead. There are weaknesses at every level of the system. It is not Sinn Féin propaganda to say that. The industry and the agencies say it, if not publicly, certainly privately.   Sinn Féin wants to see a more equitable retrofitting system, one that prioritises those living in fuel and energy poverty and targets grant support at those who need financial assistance. Middle-income earners who earn too much to avail of free energy upgrades but not enough to have money to invest in energy efficiency measures feel left behind.  We heard from the SEAI yesterday. It is behind on one-stop shop targets and on tackling the two-year backlog in the warmer home scheme. It has no plan for renters or for those just outside the eligibility criteria. The Minister of State can see a pattern here. Every scheme the Government builds, including retrofitting, EV grants and the bike to work scheme, fails the equity test. That is a problem. I am fed up listening to Government representatives congratulate themselves on climate. It is a reasonable estimate thatthis Government will miss every emission reduction target it set itself.   Government Members' defence is they are serious about climate because they have a carbon tax. This magic carbon tax is, on one hand, minuscule. The increase on 1 May will make no difference to people, we are told. On the other hand, it is the cornerstone of the Government's climate policy. It will pay for retrofitting, renewables and sustainable farming, all of which are behind schedule and have missed targets, and it will protect the most vulnerable. It will not and cannot do that. No single tax could do that. In the meantime, it will punish people for being poor and drive them against the climate agenda.   As always, there are alternatives. The money can and should be raised in a different way. For example, Sinn Féin proposed that the retrofitting budget be increased by €125m in 2022 and outlined tax increases in different areas that would fund this. A solidarity tax on those earning in excess of €140,000 and a tapering off of tax credits for those earning more than €100,000 are two examples. These two proposals would raise €408 million in a year and would not hit workers and families who are just about getting by as it is.  The science is clear, the targets are in place and we need a focus on rapid delivery from the Government if we are to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets. I echo the words of the IPCC chair: “We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future.” Carbon tax and tweaking the market will not do. Sinn Féin will play its part. We are serious about this but we want to see it delivered. It will be delivered only if it is done in a fair and equitable way. We have real concerns about the approach Government is taking. Go raibh maith agat.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-26 14:00:00+01:00	Home Heating Fuels: Motion [Private Members]	1	The initial attempt by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the issue of turf was as poorly delivered as it was designed. His latest attempt is premature, daft, unworkable and senseless. These are words from his Government colleagues. I will not repeat what colleagues on this side of the House have said but the sentiment is the same. Those same Government colleagues will have the chance to act on their words when we vote on the motion tomorrow evening.  The Government's handling of this matter has been reduced to a farce. It is another example of mismanagement from this out-of-touch Minister and out-of-touch Government. There is a failure to prepare, meaningfully engage and identify and support those who might be adversely or worst affected. There is a failure to imagine, never mind deliver, a just transition. It reads like a joke but it is a most serious matter.  We need to move away from burning dirty fossil fuels. The question is how to do so. It has to be managed in the right way. The Government will say air pollution needs to be tackled, and I agree, but if it is the case that the Government has such concern about air quality, air pollution and public health, I might ask why it is so committed to the Energy Charter Treaty, which bestows such protection on the fossil fuel industry and its potentially stranded assets. It is part of the reason we are here. It is because coal providers have rights.  If it is the case that the Government has such a concern about air quality, air pollution and public health, I might ask why, three weeks ago, Indaver Ireland was granted a licence under Government policy to increase the amount of waste it receives at its incinerator in Carranstown in my constituency to 280,000 tonnes per year. This is an increase of 45,000 tonnes per annum, of which 15,000 tonnes will be hazardous waste. What does the Government think this does to air quality? I can make a similar case about the landfill at Knockharley, which is also in my constituency. It was also granted permission under the policy of the Government for a massive, almost fivefold expansion to accept hazardous and non-hazardous waste. If we want to talk about air quality, air pollution and public health, let us have a real conversation.  With regard to this proposal, public health is central but when it comes to public health nothing is worse for health than poverty. People are not protected from poverty if they live somewhere with a population of more than 500 people. To state it explicitly, the Government's proposal will drive people into poverty. It does not have to do so but it will because once again the Government has announced a scheme that fails to support those who need to be supported. It is failing once again to deliver a just transition. The Government can speak about the environmental need to make this move, and I agree there is such a need. It can speak about the public health need for such a move, and I agree there is such a need. However, in making this move the Government must consider the impact it has on household incomes and people living in or at risk of fuel poverty. Inequity has been a feature of every climate move this Minister and Government take.  It is a damning indictment and insight into the Government's lack of commitment to a fair and just transition that the Minister cannot answer basic questions such as how many people are dependent on turf and where they live. How many of those people live in poorly insulated homes and are on fuel allowance or are otherwise eligible for retrofitting support? How can we support those people as a matter of priority? How many are not eligible and how can we support them as a matter of priority?  The Government's failure is best exemplified in the case of thousands of low-income households living in G-rated homes struggling to make ends meet which are dependent on turf to heat the building. These people are just getting by and there is absolutely nothing but pain for them in this proposal. The Government has no answer or support for them. They will not get a 100% grant for retrofitting because they are not eligible, even if such people could wait for two years. They will not get an 80% grant support for retrofit because they have no disposable income to make up the balance. Let us not talk about the €25,000 upfront cost of a deep retrofit.  The Minister and the Government must go back to the drawing board. I call on Deputies across the House to support this Sinn Féin motion.

I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I thank Deputies Cronin and Kerrane for co-sponsoring it with me.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 aims to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to include explicit provision for the Minister to provide policy direction to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to introduce a moratorium on disconnections of gas and electricity supply to domestic customers for non-payment during the annual fuel allowance season or during other periods of time the Minister may deem appropriate. It is an important power that we seek to bestow on the Minister.  We know that the risk and reality of disconnection is something we need to address in a real way. We acknowledge there are powers there already under section 10A. We know the CRU has operated a voluntary code over the years at different times, including during Covid. However, if we track the disconnections in gas and electricity over the years, the most recent figures for 2019 show that there were more than 5,000 electricity disconnections and more than 2,400 gas disconnections, which were up on the previous year. Therefore, we know that more needs to be done to protect vulnerable customers, particularly during the difficult, cold winter months.   An additional power we seek to give the Minister is discretion to identify other periods the Minister may deem appropriate to initiate a ban on disconnections - for example, during the Covid period. We acknowledge that the voluntary scheme significantly reduced the number of disconnections during the Covid period. However, that is for a limited time. We are now living at a time of hyperinflation and a huge increases in cost of petrol and diesel and in the cost of living, putting families under huge pressure. Our proposal is that we would give people the protection, particularly during the winter months or at times otherwise deemed appropriate by the Minister, and to give people some breathing space by removing that threat of disconnection from over their head, however limited that space might be. We know from the figures that when there is not protection there, disconnections happen at a significant rate. This proposal gives people a bit of space to arrange their affairs, to enter into a payment plan, to get themselves back on track in terms of repaying the debt that is owed to the supplier or to engage with other agencies, as might be appropriate, whether the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other agencies to support them through the period. It provides a protection for vulnerable customers as well as a safety net and breathing space.  In my last minute, I will point to some of the commentary when section 10A, which is the provision that is there and we seek to amend, was introduced in 2006. The then Minister of State, John Browne, said that it was important that such power should be used sparingly and always in the public interest. That is exactly what we are talking about here. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, also contributed to the debate at that time. He said the regulated model had not worked because a regulator or bureaucrat based in the Department or the CRU could not take on the political responsibility to lead and that such a person could not take a decision on something awkward, difficult or risky, and that was the role of politicians. The power we want to bestow on the Minister is to protect during the winter months and to identify those periods in which the Minister would be given the discretion to implement a ban on disconnections to protect customers.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-04-28 09:00:00+01:00	Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021: Second Stage [Private Members]	4	I thank my co-sponsors of the Bill for their contributions. We introduced the Bill on First Stage in March last year. We are in a different place now in some respects, in that the pandemic was raging at that time and war is now raging in Europe. However, from the perspective of vulnerable energy customers, we are very much in the same place and, if anything, in a far worse place.  I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's response. I will make a number of points in response to the arguments he made in defence of his position. He argues, through his amendment, that the power to impose moratoria on disconnection of electricity and gas already exists. We have acknowledged that, but there are two fundamental differences. The first is where the discretion lies and the second lies in the delivery of that power. Yes, the CRU can impose a moratorium when it sees fit to do so but we want a ban on disconnections every winter. What do we mean by winter? We mean the fuel allowance season, which does not run from 9 December to 11 January - a little more than four weeks - so that people can cook their Christmas dinner without fear of the power turning off. The fuel allowance season runs from the end of September until the start of April. Anyone who has lived through an Irish winter knows for certain that the worst weather can occur at either end of that period, particularly in the months of February and March. I know this too, having contested a by-election in 2013 in March when the ground was covered in snow every day. People know that. I challenge the Minister of State on the idea that the CRU has this power and uses it every winter. That is not the same as what we are saying. It is entirely different. The discretion of the Minister to identify periods outside winter, within which it may be appropriate to introduce a ban on disconnections, is an additional power that would be useful for him to have.  I refer to the point raised about who exercises the power. I have been in the role of spokesperson for a couple of years. In that time, I have had the opportunity to raise questions with a range of Departments, specifically on climate, communications and transport. I have never seen, in any other Department, such lack of direct ministerial accountability for matters that are the reserve of the Minister. In many cases, responsibility is deflected. Energy security is a fundamental responsibility of the Minister. If I ask questions in the House about energy security, they will be diverted to the CRU, and I will be told the CRU is accountable not to the Minister but to the Oireachtas joint committee. I am a member of that committee and I can guarantee that I speak for every member. I am not satisfied with the level of accountability of the CRU to the committee. From having sat on committees, as we all have, and it has also been reported on the national airwaves, the Minister knows about the accountability of civil servants and others to committees. That is not the case with the CRU. I mean no disrespect to the individual members of the CRU. They have their jobs to do but there are lines of responsibility. We are elected as public representatives or representatives of the people. We elect our Government, which elects our Ministers. That is the line of authority and the line of accountability back to the people. It is not to leave discretion with the CRU or another group. That is an abdication of responsibility by the Minister and is something that would be changed in the legislation, if it was adopted. I will go back to the words of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in 2006, when he spoke about departmental officials and members of the regulatory body. He stated: Such a person cannot take decisions or say something awkward, difficult or risky. In our democratic system, only politicians have the power to do that. It is a point the Minister has made, in fairness, in recent days and weeks regarding the responsibility of politicians. Accountability should lie with the Minister. That is a strength of our Bill, it is a weakness of the current position and it is a weakness in the Minister of State's argument, as far as I see it.  Those are the technical policy arguments regarding this matter, but the mean-spirited and offensive piece in the position of the Government and the Minister of State is that they are kicking the can down the road and will not act on this for 12 months. We will have another winter where the Government will be satisfied with a moratorium on disconnections for maybe four weeks. That is not good enough, by my account. We will oppose the Government's position and are likely to have a vote on it at some stage, but I ask the Minister of State to review his position on what we are saying to him. If he is saying that the provisions of our legislation are already catered for, we are firmly saying that is not the case. It is not the case in respect of where the responsibility lies and what winter means in Ireland.  The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board on this issue. He needs to get on to the Minister to provide those protections for people over these winter months. As we said, this is about providing breathing space for people over the winter months, among everything else, because they are already under pressure. I am sure the Minister of State is very familiar, as is the Minister, with the type of winter that is ahead of us. This winter, we know that fuel prices, electricity prices and gas prices have not yet fully reflected the impact or the full extent of the war in Ukraine. The Government is factoring in increases in the region of a further 50% to 70%. When we meet providers, they talk about a tsunami of indebtedness. That has the potential to be a tsunami of disconnections. This Government needs to provide protection for those customers over the winter months to provide that space for them. A handful of weeks over the Christmas period will not suffice.

Over 2,000 taxi licences have gone after Covid, and thousands of licenceholders have not returned to work. We have circumstances in which people cannot get a taxi or face an inordinate delay when they want one. At the same time, drivers are struggling to make a living. They may be busy for a short number of hours but their business is very quiet beyond those hours. There are increases in running costs. I encourage the Minister to review the taxi advisory committee's ten-year rule and come forward with a fare increase. Is he concerned about the health and viability of the taxi industry? Will he engage with the representative groups?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-05 09:00:00+01:00	Regulations for the Sale and Distribution of Turf: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I thank the Independent Group for bringing this motion. It seeks to go some way towards filling a vacuum left by the Government when it jumped, so dreadfully ill-prepared, to announce a ban on the sale and distribution of turf. The motion seeks to clarify what is meant by ""turbary rights""; those can come in different ways and forms and the motion seeks to exempt certain identified groups. It also calls on the Government to work with the industry to look at the standard and performance of turf and its comparison with so-called acceptable solid fuels.  The fact that we are debating this motion at this stage and that it is an Opposition motion shows how Government has failed so miserably in the basic business of Government: planning; preparation; engagement; support; and communication. Despite lots of talk about the issue of turf and lots of pontification and vilification, the truth is the Government made a hames of this and it has no one but itself to blame. The vast majority of people using turf are living in rural Ireland, often in colder homes. Many earn too much to qualify for the free energy upgrades and have little to no disposable income that they can put towards a retrofit of their homes, even with the 50% grant. Even for those who qualify for the free energy upgrades, there is a two-year waiting list with a backlog of 7,000 people and Government is making slow progress towards addressing that backlog. When the Government's half-baked plan was brought forward, devoid of the basic statistics on energy poverty and turf use and containing no proposed alternatives, people had a right to be concerned and the Opposition had a right to challenge the Government to do better. We all recognise the need to move from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives. That is not in dispute but the Government needs to work with people to assist them through this major energy transition.  A just transition is a critical component of climate action. It means bringing together workers, communities, employers and Government in social dialogue to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fair and fast transformation to a low carbon economy and to ensure employment and jobs in the new economy are as decent and well-paid as those left behind. This Government refused to accept our amendments to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which would have defined a just transition and climate justice and ensured the climate action plan was drafted with reference to just transition principles. It was a real shame that the Government refused our constructive suggestions and the resulting climate policies are weaker as a result. The same can be said of the amendments brought forward by Deputy Whitmore on the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 earlier this week that were opposed. The amendments sought that just transition principles would be included in that Bill but they were opposed by the Government.  Most of the Government's policies are missing that key just transition element and that is a choice and decision of the Government. The midlands was the first major area promised a just transition as the peat-burning power stations were wound down. Unfortunately, jobs, reskilling and investment have not materialised and communities feel left behind. They feel they were sold a pup because they were. This is another reason the Government's proposed ban on the sale of turf went down so poorly. It did so because those it will impact are centralised in the midlands in particular, with this motion highlighting that in some counties up to 34% of households are solely dependent on turf as solid fuel. There is a level of mistrust that is of the Government's own making and it is important that the Government seeks to address it. It is doing real harm to the climate agenda. From this Government, as with previous Governments, people see failure, hypocrisy and inequity.  The urgent need to tackle climate change is not in question. We all know we need to move urgently towards a zero carbon society and economy and this will take action from individuals, businesses and the State. The Government is failing in its responsibility. It is high on rhetoric and low on delivery and at the heart of every scheme it designs is inequity. Yesterday, for example, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, highlighted a 6.3% growth in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions last year. This is extremely worrying considering we need to reduce overall emission by 4.7% each year in the first half of this decade to meet our 2030 emissions reductions targets. Slow action and input to policies are contributing to this move in the wrong direction. On the one hand the Minister is telling ordinary people to cut energy use while on the other hand doing nothing to curb the uncontrolled growth of energy-sapping data centres. Data centres are already using more electricity than all rural houses combined and this is set to more than double out to 2030. People see the hypocrisy in Government policy and action and they will not stand for it."

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-18 09:10:00+01:00	Just Transition: Statements	1	I welcome these statements. They take place on the day of the publication of another major report outlining the damage global warming is doing to our planet and all its inhabitants. The State of the Global Climate report from the World Meteorological Organization, WMO, shows that the four key climate change indicators - greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification - broke records in 2021. The WMO said this is another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes with long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems. The findings and statistics in this report and the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, findings will come as no shock to most, as the science has been clear for decades. What has been missing, however, is action. We know what needs to be done and we know how to do it. What we need now is the Government to lead and deliver.  There will be no transition without a just transition. That is a matter of fact. A just transition is a critical component of climate action. A just transition means the bringing together of workers, communities, employers and the Government in social dialogue in order to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fast and fair transformation to a low-carbon economy and to ensure that employment and jobs in the new economy are as decent and well-paid as those left behind. I wish to raise concerns, first, with the timelines, but also with the narrow scope of what the Government means by a just transition, which seems to be limited to the midlands. It certainly needs to apply there, but it also needs to apply in the broadest sense to everybody who is involved in this transition.  We discussed the importance of a just transition and climate justice at length during the extensive debates on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. During those debates, Sinn Féin and others brought forward amendments that would have defined what constitutes a just transition in the Act and ensured that the climate action plans were drafted with reference to just transition principles. The Government rejected all amendments tabled on Committee Stage and Report Stage however, and, as a result, the Act and the climate policies flowing from it are weaker because they fail to meet the bar of equity and fairness. They fail to deliver a just transition.  Retrofitting is one such policy area that is failing the just transition equity test. Sinn Féin agrees that we need to retrofit the housing stock to reduce emissions and energy use, but where we disagree is how the Government is approaching it. The Minister has introduced a new scheme this year, which prioritises ability to pay over need. If someone is fortunate enough to have €25,000 available, he or she can now get a grant of €25,000 to retrofit their home, regardless of whether the financial help is needed. I am sure the Minister of State will tell us this is balanced out by the free energy upgrades for others, but what he fails to mention is the 8,000 homes already on the growing waiting list and a delay of 27 months to get works done. The target of completing 400 homes a month is still not being achieved, despite what has been claimed by some. Under the new plan, those who have money are generously supported to get a warmer home sooner. They are at the top of the list. For every euro in carbon tax they pay, they are getting a very good return. People who qualify for the free energy upgrade must sit tight for two years or more. Someone might get to them eventually. All the while they will pay more in carbon tax to heat their homes. They will get some return on the carbon tax, but it will be slow and in the vast majority of cases the retrofits are not deep retrofits. However, renters or those on a low income who earn too much to qualify for the free scheme but not enough to afford works themselves, like very many people, are out of luck. Such people will get no return on their carbon tax.  The national retrofit scheme is devoid of equity. It is benefiting those with means over those in need, and was not designed with a just transition in mind. There is a better, fairer way. We could start with the national social housing stock. We could identify those living in fuel poverty or reliant on solid fuels and start with them. We could put an income cap in place to ensure more money can be targeted at those who need it most. There are options in this area, but the Government is choosing not to take them. It is a long way off a just transition, but at the very least we should make sure that this transition does not drive people into poverty or further into poverty. The Government is failing to do that. It is just transition, it is not just stop being poor transition.  It is not just the retrofitting policy that fails the test, it is the same when it comes to electric vehicle grants. People with the money to buy a brand-new €50,000 car can get a €5,000 grant and €5,000 off the vehicle registration tax, VRT. They will also get a home charger grant, cheaper motor tax and reduced tolls. That is a very good return on their carbon tax. If, like most, however, you are unable to afford a new car, there is nothing for you except higher prices at the forecourts due to the ever-increasing costs. Similarly, PAYE workers can get a significant discount on a bicycle or an e-bike, but there is nothing for students, the self-employed or unemployed. To state it clearly again, Sinn Féin agrees with retrofitting. We agree with the need for electric vehicles. We agree with the need to get more people cycling and involved in active travel, but we want to see fairer policies that will deliver these measures while prioritising those most in need. We need an approach encompassing a just transition. The Government's alternative is driving a wedge between people. It is leaving people behind and in the only measure that matter, emissions reductions, it is failing miserably.  The Minister will have received correspondence in advance of this debate from the Just Transition Alliance. This alliance includes the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, TASC, SIPTU, Fórsa, Friends of the Earth and others. They have called for the establishment of a national just transition commission, in advance of formal legislation at the end of the year, based on social dialogue and comprised of representatives of the Government, trade unions, employers, affected communities and civil society. The commission would focus on job retention; the protection of living standards; skills development; the creation of decent work in respect of new employment opportunities; the prioritisation of the most vulnerable regions and sectors; and would be underpinned by a commitment to genuine community and regional development. Sinn Féin supports this call. I hope the Minister of State can update us on this area.  The transition to a zero-carbon society and economy does not have to be punitive or achieved through eco-austerity. The framing is completely wrong. This transition should transform and improve the lives of millions in this country by means of warmer homes, cleaner air, shorter commutes, cheaper electricity and greener spaces. Unfortunately, this Government's approach means that most people just see cost. They see hypocrisy when it comes to data centres, and they see unfairness when it comes to policies. We need to invest in public transport; build good quality public housing; invest in wind and solar renewable energy; undertake a truly ambitious afforestation programme; and retrofit our national housing stock, starting with those in need, not those with ability to pay. A just transition should be at the heart of all Government policies, and it is conspicuous by its absence at the moment.

We had some of the team in the audiovisual room last Tuesday, before the first day of strike action. Most of all, I commend medical scientists from right around the country on the resolve they have shown. Others have talked about the fundamental issues at play here, including pay parity, the 20-year claim and the expert review. The present Taoiseach was the Minister responsible at the time. Others have pointed to the addition of insult to injury among laboratory aides. I do not think there is a medical scientist in the country who would deny laboratory aides the wage they get. It is a recognition of the valuable contribution they make. It is, however, a further indication of the contradiction within the system that the people to whom they are answerable get paid less than them.  I welcome the fact there is an engagement at the Labour Court but, as my colleagues have said, it must be a meaningful one and must come with an understanding of the issues and a willingness and an ability to find solutions. I implore the Minister to engage with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to find those solutions and to be creative. There is huge opportunity to be creative here and it needs to extend beyond 1%.  I will touch on two major issues. I worked as a medical scientist and, looking now from the outside in, I wish to reflect on my experience of that profession and to touch on two issues: dedication and excellence.  Many Members have talked about dedication. This is a 24-7, 365-day service, including Christmas Day, New Year's Day and bank holidays, whether 3 o'clock in the morning or 3 o'clock in the evening, and harsh winters, including those of 2013 and 2017. Some colleagues mentioned staff working 15 days straight during Covid. At times, including during Storm Ophelia, medical scientists have not left the building for up to a week without thinking twice about it, such is their level of dedication. It is mainly women who do this work, including during Covid. Where was the support for childcare at that time? It was not there. That was another example. When I started work as a medical scientist, some of my colleagues had lived with the marriage bar. I think it is no coincidence we are in this position with a profession dominated by women.  I wish to touch on the issue of excellence. We do not see it in very many places. In medical science there is a culture of excellence driven by the staff's dedication and commitment, which has not been for reward, because the Government has introduced a glass ceiling for them. As colleagues have said, they are an essential part of practically every clinical decision. They have degrees, including masters degrees. Some have multiple masters degrees, PhDs, FRCPaths and MRCPaths. The internal journal is called   This is pioneering science, not off-the-shelf stuff. In many cases staff build these assays from the ground up. We have seen during Covid-19, in practically every lab, staff do their own basic science, pure science, building the assays, including the most high-tech of molecular science, from the ground up. These are fully accredited laboratories. It was the Joint Commission when I started; now it is INAB 15189. There is an obligation on transfusion labs. The other labs do it because they want to maintain the highest standards. The recruitment and retention crisis the Government has created is putting those standards under pressure. There is a spectacular opportunity here. These are the best of public services. We should be putting them up in lights and rewarding them, and that is what the Minister needs to do.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-31 14:00:00+01:00	Transport, Accelerating Sustainable Mobility: Statements	5	This is the Minister's first time in the Dáil Chamber since the incidents of the weekend. He is the Minister for Transport. The people of Ireland are looking to the Minister and his Department for leadership on this matter. The Minister can take it or leave it, but my opinion is that to neglect that, not reference it and not provide confidence and comfort to people who either went through the experience of Dublin Airport at the weekend or who will be travelling next weekend or further into the future, is incredible.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter of transport. While there are many areas I could focus on, the events of the weekend put one matter ahead of all others. As an island nation, air connectivity is vital for family, social, tourism and business purposes. The aviation sector has endured two difficult years during the pandemic with many workers losing their jobs and thousands of others suffering severe pay cuts. A rapid return to normality was hoped for and thankfully that is now materialising. Unfortunately, our main State airport failed to read the signs of recovery over the past year and was completely ill-prepared for the long-awaited rebound.  During the pandemic, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, slashed employee numbers. It cut 1,000 staff. That was completely excessive, short-sighted and highlighted a total disregard for workers. It was also incredibly ill-judged for an authority with responsibility in the aviation sector. The DAA is now scrambling to refill these jobs, which should not have been abolished in the first place. In short, abolishing them was a penny-wise-and-pound-foolish approach. If the DAA had talked to a sinner soul on this island during the pandemic, it would have known that people were chomping at the bit to get back to travel. In addition, Ireland is home to Ryanair, one of the most successful and aggressive airlines on the planet. As a result, the airport should have been better prepared for a more rapid aviation recovery compared with other airports. If aviation was going to recover anywhere, it was going to recover in Ireland. Instead, the DAA was caught on the hop and passengers have paid the price.  Dublin Airport management is simply not performing, and that is not just when it comes to unacceptable security wait times. Complaints have been made about the uncleanliness of the airport, long queues for food and beverage outlets in the terminals, more delays for baggage pick-up and the struggle to get taxis. We even saw an ugly brawl in the terminal recently. The Garda response to the incident was slow, despite the opening of a brand-new Garda station in the airport this month. It all adds up to an unpleasant experience for passengers, with many dreading the thought of using the airport to go to and from Ireland.  It is having an incredibly negative impact on our international reputation. We spend millions each year marketing Ireland as a great tourist destination but coverage of this travel chaos on the BBC, in   I raised the issue of security delays with the Minister at the start of April when the problem arose ahead of the Easter break. I asked him what action he was taking to address this problem. The Minister said he was monitoring the situation and was arranging meetings with the management of the airport. The same response came yesterday when yet another meeting took place with management. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, have stated that they will now hold daily meetings with management about this problem. Meetings are all we have had. That is it. What have these meetings achieved to date and what is discussed at them? By the look of things, it is not solutions.  The Government has a really important role to play in this matter. We are talking about the busiest State airport in the country, with 85% of all air traffic going through it. There are solutions the Government can push to help to fix this issue. First, excellent pay and working conditions are central to resolving it. There have been reports about low pay, long shifts and issues with workers getting paid their overtime. Good pay and conditions will help to attract and retain security staff in our airports. In the short term, extra personnel clearly need to be drafted into Dublin Airport, whether from other airports or, for example, by utilising Army personnel. Everything needs to be on the table. We also need to see a fast-tracking of recruitment and training for new staff.  In the medium term, as well as investment in workers, we need to see investment in new security screening equipment. Last year, Shannon Airport invested in upgrading its security machines, which removes the need to take liquids and laptops out of bags. This has the potential to speed things up significantly. In the longer term, we need a plan to rebalance some of the Dublin Airport traffic to other airports, including Cork, Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock. As I said, 85% of traffic currently goes through Dublin.  The Minister for Transport cannot wash his hands of this problem. All Ministers needs to step up and take responsibility. They cannot just turn up at the airport when a ribbon needs cutting. When the pressure is on, they need to stand up and be counted.

They are consistent with attempts made by the Opposition at various stages, including in the debate on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and on earlier Stages of this Bill, to enshrine the principles of just transition in legislation in Ireland. We look towards other jurisdictions - Scotland, for example - where this has been done. It makes a difference because it enshrines a commitment in this regard in law. It means that all of the policy that stems from the important legislation in this area must be in line with those principles.  In recent weeks, we had statements in the House on a just transition. One can see there is a really narrow focus from the Government on particular geographical areas and particular cohorts. In fact, a commitment to just transition needs to permeate absolutely everything we do in terms of climate change. Today's report from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, refers specifically to the need for implementation and action. Much of the resistance to climate action is because of the unjust and unfair way in which it is being imposed and delivered. People are not being given the opportunity to see the benefits of, and everything that is positive about, essential climate action.  It speaks volumes that there is such resistance to amendments like these linked ones that have been put forward by Deputy Cairns. I hope the Minister will support them. However, if past performance is any indication, there will be opposition to them. I question where that opposition comes from. If we are serious about delivering on the targets that have been set and agreed on so widely, then the definition of the principles of just transition, in the broadest possible sense, is fundamental to the real-world delivery of those targets. We must ensure people on the front line, in such sectors as the fossil fuel industry, are protected. However, it is necessary for everybody to make a transition. For every decision we make, we need to think in terms of just transition, equity and ensuring the policy decisions that are made do not drive people into poverty, including fuel poverty, or further into poverty. It is fair enough if measures taken reduce some people's wealth but they should not drive people into poverty or further into poverty. Unfortunately, that is what is happening with some of the measures we have seen from the Government. I support these amendments.

They have taken on board some of what the Opposition and some Government Members said during that debate. That said, there is an opportunity to go further and I share concerns that it does not adequately capture the potential of the circular economy. At the moment, perversely, the limited plastics recycling facilities that we have on the island cannot source plastics from this State because it is more profitable to export them elsewhere. We must consider also the carbon footprint associated with that. It is ludicrous that it is circular but far from the spirit of what circular could mean and should mean. This needs to be addressed. I do not believe this captures it sufficiently.

This is a long-standing issue with regard to supports for people with medical-associated additional waste needs. It is very unfair and is one of those things that frustrates people. It affects a small number of people, is cruel and needs to be resolved. Looking at parliamentary questions, this issue comes up across the political spectrum. Everybody seems to agree on it but nothing changes. Now is an opportune time to do something about it and I support Deputy Sherlock's call in that regard.

I welcome the fact the Minister has brought forward amendment No. 19 on foot of discussions on Committee Stage. We raised previously the prospect of taking an initiative such as that which was taken in France. The Department indicated there were considerations in the Irish market that differed from those in the French market, such as longer supply chains, but I welcome the commitment to preparing a report and assessing the prospect and how such a change might be implemented in an Irish context.

There will be further discussion in the Seanad and colleagues of mine will bring forward amendments, as I am sure others will as well.  I am disappointed there were not amendments on CCTV and the need for caution with it. Significantly more needs to be done in the area of product obsolescence. I would, given the opportunity, have supported the amendment from the Labour Party. We need to see action on that. On Committee Stage, the Government pointed to the need to act at a European level. We need to see more on that. We need to see the deposit return scheme. I share the concerns of other Deputies about the possible unintended consequences of the latte levy and the implications there. I think we will bring forward amendments on that in the Seanad. There is a crazy anomaly with the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, plastics in Ireland. Due to the configuration of levies and incentives here, it makes more sense to export it to I do not where - certainly the four corners of Europe, if not of the world - than it does to run it up the road to County Monaghan so it can be done here. The Minister has been contacted by Shabra Plastics and Recycling Limited and I know there are ongoing discussions. It makes no sense at all. State agencies such as Repak and others are a part of that mix and it has to be resolved.

Shifting our energy sector away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives will be key to reducing our carbon emissions. In addition to major investment in offshore and offshore wind and solar, microgeneration will play an important role in our energy transition.  We have thousands of State-owned schools and community buildings across the country that are perfectly placed to generate clean energy via solar photovoltaic, PV. This is as much about empowerment as anything else. People have paid in to climate action but they have not necessarily been allowed buy in. This is a real opportunity.  This is the lowest of the low hanging fruit. We are bringing forward this legislation. We know there is other legislation there but this is our way of banging the table and saying to the Government to get on with, and we will support it in, the work.  A colleague, Deputy Stanley, brought forward similar legislation in 2019 and, in 2017, brought forward the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill. This is the low-hanging fruit. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said yesterday that there is climate rhetoric but not climate action and the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, says the same. There is one word, and I note the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was at the conference yesterday with the EPA, namely, ""implementation."" That is what this Bill is about.  I hope the Minister takes it in the spirit in which it is intended but we need to see action in relation to it. There are so many positive benefits of this, including opportunities for schools and communities. It is the real opportunity of the climate transition. It is fundamentally about a just transition."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-14 14:00:00+01:00	Special Educational Needs School Places: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and important motion. I commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire on bringing it forward. I also commend FUSS Ireland on its activism on these issues. As Deputy Ward said, its members were out across the country, including in Dublin, on Saturday. I had an opportunity to meet with Rachel Martin of FUSS Ireland in my constituency on Friday. The activism and energy that are committed by parents of children with disabilities, who have so many caring responsibilities, is to be commended. The name of the organisation, FUSS Ireland, indicates what these parents are fighting for, that is, services and supports for their children. It is shameful that they have to expend such energy to keep fighting for what should be basic and fundamental rights.  There is a failure to plan, prepare and resource services at practically every level. Ministers talk about investment and offer statistics and figures, but the question of unmet need is really where the focus needs to be. In the case of special education, that includes the provision of assessments, therapies, services, school places, including in special schools, special classes and special units at primary and secondary level, and the provision of special needs assistants.  I commend the motion and join others in encouraging the Minister to support it. It is an awful shame that parents have to make such efforts on behalf of their children. There are deep concerns for the coming September and even more concerns for September 2023. There are significant merits in the proposals set out in the motion. They must be acted upon. Provision must be made for the rights, entitlements and basic dignity of these young people.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-15 09:10:00+01:00	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	1	The Rural Independent Group has identified a problem but, unfortunately, it has looked in exactly the wrong place for the solution. We have an energy security crisis and the Government has significantly contributed to it. We have an energy cost crisis and the Government has significantly contributed to it. The Rural Independent Group suggests, however, that the answer is new fossil fuel infrastructure, which would be hugely damaging to the environment and would do little for energy security, particularly considering the locking in of such fossil fuel use. We are looking at countries spending billions of euro to buy themselves out of the type of contracts that would be needed if this motion were to succeed. Such infrastructure would last 30 or 40 years. That would take us well past 2050 and any prospect of delivering on emissions reduction targets and, whatever it might do for energy security, it would do absolutely nothing for energy costs. Do we get Corrib gas cheaper than we get Qatari or British gas? No, we do not. Sinn Féin therefore does not support this motion.  We do not support the Government's countermotion either because there is absolutely zero acknowledgement in it of the Government's role in sleepwalking the State into this energy security and energy cost crisis. There is no mention of data centre policy. As recently as yesterday, we had reports that the energy generation being procured by the State to prevent power outages in winter 2023 will cover only about 60% of the generation gap that might arise. Why? It is largely because of data centres. There is no mention that we have become more dependent, not less, on fossil fuels in recent years thanks to a complete failure of policy. There is no mention of the Government's failure, along with the ESB and the CRU, to deliver on committed capacity. Capacity is committed and there is failure to deliver on it. There is no mention of the failure to deliver on our offshore wind potential. If the Government will not take Sinn Féin's advice as to what needs to be done, there is an article practically every week in the   What is in the Government's countermotion? There is mention of a framework with 31 responses. That will be cold comfort to anybody faced with the reality of runaway fuel and energy costs.  The energy security review needs to be urgently concluded and published. That should have been done already. The Government needs to set out a comprehensive and coherent plan to deliver energy security, with all options on the table. It must deliver a just transition and the most rapid and fair transition to a net-zero energy system. We need to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind energy by providing the funding and resources needed to agencies such as An Bord Pleanála to ensure that long planning delays are avoided. We need to establish a cross-government, high-level task force to bring forward recommendations on how to lower the price of renewable energy here because it is not just fossil fuel energy but also renewable energy that is too expensive in Ireland. We need to draft and publish a national strategy on green energy. In the first instance, the most important thing the Government needs to do to protect consumers is to introduce an emergency budget that provides targeted measures to help households struggling to meet increasing energy costs. This Government and previous ones have pursued failed policies that have brought us to the brink. People know what amber alerts are now because they are part of the public conversation. That is an absolute failure of Government policy to match energy demand with energy supply. It is totally within the gift of the Government to deliver on that, and it needs to do so.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-15 09:10:00+01:00	Annual Transition Statement: Statements	1	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Although the annual transition statements framework was abolished and replaced with a new process under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, this gives us a good opportunity to reflect on the Government’s progress to date on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and take on board suggestions from the Opposition on actions that need to be taken. I will pick up on one of the Minister of State's final comments that ""we must consider how to accelerate the delivery of measures and actions"". We are really in a space in which we need implementation. It is the number one word we heard from the EPA. Let us get on with the considering but, more importantly, let us get on with the action. There are many frameworks, plans and reports but there is an acute shortage of action.  The Government committed in the programme for Government to cut emissions by an average of 7% per annum over its lifetime. Unfortunately, what is coming to pass is very different. I know the figure of 7% is contested but it is certainly the figure in the programme for Government, if not in the carbon budgets. After a fall in emissions in 2020, due significantly to the shuttering of the economy and people being confined to their homes, we are back to business as usual with our national emissions increasing last year and almost certainly this year too.  Total greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have increased by 6% in 2021, as the Minister of State has indicated, rather than decreased by the required 4.8% as per the Climate Change Advisory Council’s carbon budgets. In addition, earlier this year, the head of the EPA said emissions are again unlikely to fall in 2022. Either way, it is a long way off where we need to be. I am not highlighting these failures to try to score political points. We are serious about these matters. We want to meet our targets because it is beyond party politics. This is very important but, of course, there are huge wheels to turn and many component parts in making policy work and delivering on those objectives. That is where the differences arise between my party and the Government.  Missed climate targets are a loss for everyone, not least the climate, and make the 2030 target, for whoever is in government, even harder to reach. The incoherent Government policy that is contributing to these missed emission targets needs to be called out. Yesterday, it was announced that the State is set to spend €350 million on new gas-powered generators, due entirely to the failure of this Government and previous Governments to appropriately balance our electricity demand and supply. This means much-needed investment is being redirected from renewables and into fossil fuel infrastructure. There is an opportunity cost with every ounce of energy and euro that we put into this infrastructure.  Data centres drive the instability in our electricity system and place a massive burden on it. The previous Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres and sought to make Ireland, especially Dublin, the data centre capital of the world, or certainly of Europe, with no thought given to the impact this would have on our electricity supply or carbon emissions. There was certainly no tangible indication that any thought was given to it. The current Government has not changed approach sufficiently, despite our more ambitious climate targets and the increased threat of electricity blackouts. People are familiar with the term ""amber alert"" now in a way they never were before. Data centres now use as much electricity as all the homes in rural Ireland combined. Their consumption is set to at least double by 2030. This is already putting severe pressure on our energy system and cannot be consistent with our emission reduction targets. It is a policy choice that this Government made over our climate targets.  The recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change further reinforce the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change. Our energy sector has huge potential to deliver significant carbon savings. Sinn Féin has called for an acceleration in the delivery of renewables, particularly offshore wind and green hydrogen. The length of time it takes to deliver offshore wind, from concept to generation, is far too long. We need to speed up this process. We are happy to work with the Government to provide clear proposals in that regard and support constructive measures from the Government. The Government can do this by fully resourcing the agencies involved, such as An Bord Pleanála, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. I have repeatedly raised this with the Minister.  Our island has significant potential relating to green hydrogen, but we still have no national plan in this area. The price of renewables in the latest RESS auction is far too high. Sinn Féin has called for the establishment of a cross-government high-level task force to bring forward recommendations on how to lower the price of renewable energy here. Policy options can be implemented to reduce the cost of renewables. EirGrid says the auction itself will do it, but it is not doing so. That is another immediate move the Minister can make, but we see no action in this area. The Government and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are holding firm in their position. Simple measures like removing the planning barriers for schools to install solar photovoltaics took two full years for this Government to begin to address. We have now entered a public consultation phase on it. This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit. I do not know of anybody who opposes this measure. I know Departments and institutions have their way of working, but given the state of the crisis, it looks like a government-as-usual approach. The Government needs to focus on unravelling those knots and getting through those processes immediately. As another example, five years since Sinn Féin introduced a Bill on microgeneration in the Dáil, people are still not getting paid for the clean energy they are exporting to the grid.  There are many opportunities relating to transport. I welcome the progress that has been made on fares. Much more can be done by expanding Connecting Ireland. Its funding needs to be increased. There is significant opportunity for progress, but every time the Government designs schemes, they fail the equity test and the just transition test. That acts as a barrier to progressive climate action."

By September, the HSE intends to close all intensive care unit beds in the hospital and to close the emergency department and replace it with a medical assessment unit. This clear intention was restated yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health by Mr. Paul Reid, despite no additional capacity in place in Drogheda and no additional GP or community capacity even planned.  At the same time, the Minister for Health and the three Ministers in government from County Meath act like commentators. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, was on local radio this morning and said she is frustrated by the process. What exactly does she think her role is? How does she think the people of County Meath feel? Instead of pausing and pausing again this process, the Government needs to stop it and invest in emergency services at Navan. On behalf of the Government, and as all of County Meath looks on today, will the Minister commit to that?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-16 09:00:00+01:00	Emissions in the Transport Sector Report: Motion	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and report. I thank the previous speakers, the Chair and the Minister of State for being here. I also thank the witnesses, the committee secretariat and the committee members for their input to the process.  We know that the current emissions situation is not good. After a fall in emissions in 2020, we are back to business as usual and our national emissions are rising. Total greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have increased by 6% in 2021. They did not decrease as is required in the carbon budgets. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has said those emissions are not likely to fall this year either. In fact, they are more likely to increase.  Transport has been cited by the Minister as one of the more difficult areas in which to reduce emissions. That is why I think this report is particularly important. It touches on many areas. There are many opportunities if the right approach is taken.  I welcome the reduction in public transport fares that were introduced earlier this year. This report examined public transport in detail and explored what else we could do to get people out of private cars and onto buses and trains.  Recommendation 22 proposes that a free public transport system should be costed as an option to encourage the uptake of public transport in Ireland. In response to this recommendation, I asked the Minister in January if he would examine it. He referred the matter to the NTA. The response from the authority was that it does not have a work programme for examining the provision of free public transport because this is not currently an objective of the Government's public transport policy.  There is a balance to be struck in respect of these issues in terms of the capital and current investment in the delivery of services and a reduction in fares. Obviously, in any comprehensive and attractive public transport system, availability and affordability are very important factors. We need to continue on the road of expanding services while also ensuring that fares are not driving people away. We need to continue the expansion of services and BusConnects was mentioned in that context. At the very least, in light of the current cost-of-living crisis, we need to see a continuation of the 20% fare reduction and examine how that might be expanded. Is there anything more that could be done on the youth travel card? Perhaps we could build on that because we are beginning to see the benefits of those reduced fares. We also need to include private operators in these schemes. The reality is that we have a blended mix of public transport provision and I am concerned that we might run ourselves off the edge of a cliff by not adequately supporting private operators.  The climate action plan sets out a target of 1 million EVs on our roads by 2030. The transition away from diesel and petrol cars will deliver significant emissions reductions. EVs are not the solution everywhere. There are more attractive alternatives, especially in urban areas. We have to be realistic about our spatial distribution of settlements, however, and EVs will have an important role to play. That said, the EV schemes that this State has designed and delivered over the years are offensive. They represent a massive transfer of wealth. In terms of the policy objective, what we want to achieve in the first instance is getting those people who are dependent on cars or vans into EVs. They are the people we want in these vehicles but they are the last people who will be in them. The Government's EV subsidy scheme is a massive transfer of wealth, with very expensive vehicles being bought. That has decreased somewhat but has not gone far enough. The figures for the EVs bought under the scheme in the last year reveal that 5,391 vehicles purchased cost in excess of €50,000. In contrast, just 53 grants were provided for vehicles costing less than €30,000. One does not need to be a genius to work out who is availing of these grant and the sort of advantage they already have before any transaction takes place.  I will again make the case that the Government needs to explore the opportunity of a second-hand EV market. Brexit is a factor in this in terms of the impact of the British market being closed off. There are ideas within the second-hand EV market in Ireland to address that and they need to be considered. We also need to consider the commercial sector, in particular the van market. People are going to be driving vans into the future because they do not have a public transport alternative so we need an EV scheme for them too. The Department is considering options in that regard but it needs to move quickly. The fundamental piece involves bringing people with us. People can see the current scheme for exactly what is, which is one that advantages the already advantaged and that understandably annoys them.  I also want to raise the issue of taxis, which are an essential part of our transport network. Again, I am deeply concerned that we are at risk of running off the edge of a cliff at the end of this year with the ten-year rule. It is a massive problem for taxi drivers. The rule means that older cars have to be replaced when they get to a certain age. A total of 5,344 vehicles in the taxi fleet will reach their maximum age in 2023. There is a real risk that those vehicles will be taken out of the system and we will have a crisis within the taxi sector. There is also a risk that the taxi drivers who are in a position to change their cars will replace them with petrol and diesel cars, even though those vehicles do not really need to be replaced, because they cannot get EVs because of the supply chain issues. The transition to an electric taxi fleet could be managed better if we extend the ten-year rule.  I have already referred to rural transport. On transport infrastructure projects, the Navan rail line needs to be delivered, as does MetroLink and the western rail corridor. These are significant investments. School transport is a low-hanging fruit opportunity. That the State is denying children the opportunity to take public transport to school outside of 5 km or outside of walking distance is unforgivable. The school bus scheme needs to be expanded.  In haulage, there is an impasse and it is frustrating to watch. It is really important that the Minister engage with the industry and listens to its views on the types of solutions that can and will work. I get frustrated when I hear about impasses and a lack of willingness to engage. That needs to be addressed. I know there is an ongoing review of our ports policy. We need to avail of opportunities to maximise the potential of our ports in the context of the green economy more broadly. We must also reduce emissions in our ports.  Active travel presents significant opportunities. In response to a point made by Deputy Leddin, this is a politically contested arena and we need to recognise that. Of course some people will play games with it and for a lot of people this is not priority number one. In that context, it is about showing leadership and showing people how this stuff works. It is about designing schemes that are not inherently inequitable and that do not put people's noses out of joint straight away. People need to see the opportunities in active travel. They need to see that it will work for them. We need to show them positive examples, and the Minister of State mentioned a number of them earlier.   Time is of the essence. We need to look at rolling this stuff out rapidly and at scale. We need to look at the planning system and how to do that but, ultimately, we must engage with people and design schemes that work for them. It can be done.

The HSE's plan is very clear, and it was spelled out in black and white, but it is just a plan. This is surprising because it has had 13 years to prepare it: nine years if one starts the clock from the small hospital framework. We are still none the wiser as to the Government's plan, and this includes the Minister's amendment here tonight. Frankly, this is disgraceful.  We are aware the HSE has a plan and Deputy Cullinane outlined some of the detail of that. It states it has legitimate concerns for safety but in my firm opinion the HSE's so-called solution will make matters worse. The concern is that in the region of 2,000 patients would present to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, who the HSE believes should go directly to Drogheda.  The medical assessment unit that is proposed to deal with up to 90% of the patients currently presenting to Navan will not work. I want this on the record of the Dáil. It will not work because it is GP referral only. Our GPs are already overworked and overbooked during the day, and it is even worse at night. What will happen? If a person is ill at home, he or she will go to the door that will accept them. It will not be five a day or 2,000 a year. Up to 20,000 people per year would present at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. They may not be appropriate presentations, but they will be there and there is deep concern about this. We are hearing this spelled out in detail from clinicians on the front line. There is deep concern that those people who are currently presenting to Navan will all, or in very significant numbers, present to Drogheda and lead to worse outcomes and worse safety rather than better. I wish to spell this out clearly. We have heard from GPs and, while there are differences of opinion in the medical world, I believe that in practical terms this is exactly what will happen. I encourage the Minister to listen to that.  The suggestion that there is no alternative to this proposal is simply not the case. At the meeting last night, we heard from one clinician who said that the only alternative to this proposal was to quadruple capacity at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and to turn it from a 107-bed hospital to a 400-bed hospital. The idea that no hospital could exist if it was not a 400-bed hospital is just outrageous. Within the medical profession, there is a belief that to bring Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, up to a model three hospital rather than downgrading it, it needs an extra emergency department consultant; two extra consultant surgeons; and two extra consultant anaesthetists. That is the proposal there and I believe the Minister should take it on board.  It is completely unacceptable that we have a clear proposal from the HSE that is scrambling. Anybody who attended that meeting last Monday in good faith could not be convinced that the HSE has a coherent plan to deliver a safe service for the people of County Meath. The ambition for increased capacity in the acute services was the subject of ongoing discussions. There was no clear plan for increased capacity in community or general practice. In fact, we heard that everybody has problems in terms of general practice.  I have had enough of Ministers in my county and at a senior level acting as observers and commentators. I heard it on LMFM and read it in the

Last week, the Tánaiste pointed to Uber and Lyft as a possible solution. He said they are just not available in Ireland in the same way and maybe we need to look at that again to see if we can liberalise that. Those comments caused significant concern, not least with the National Transport Authority, NTA, which stated it would undermine the regulated taxi market, that we would lose both drivers and vehicles from the regulated market and that it would have a negative impact on customers and services. I agree with that. Will the Tánaiste confirm that that is his position, his party's position or the Government’s position? Does he not agree that a far better approach would be to address the challenges in the taxi sector, such as fuel costs, the fare structure and the ten-year rule, and to expand all late-night public transport options, rather than this lurch to the gig economy?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-28 14:00:00+01:00	EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	I would like to register my concern at the rushed nature of this Bill. Deputies only got sight of the Bill last Tuesday and it has not undergone any pre-legislative scrutiny, although we had a briefing on it, which was welcome. We in Sinn Féin and others in opposition had other important questions we wanted answered and we wanted to hear from stakeholders. There are still very many unanswered questions but we did not have the opportunity to deal with them. As is often the case, the Government had the numbers so pre-legislative scrutiny was waived and we are where we are. The Bill is now being rushed through all the legislative Stages as the Government scrambles to ensure the lights will stay on in winter 2023. That is an incredible situation to have left us in.  We will be constructive and we will engage, but we need to shine a light on the issues that got us to where we are. Successive Governments have walked us to the cliff edge and this Government is now in a rush and panic. Opposition parties got just one day to read the Bill and submit amendments, and I will touch on a number of Sinn Féin amendments. I make the point that rushed legislation often results in bad legislation and bad law. For a Bill dealing with a number of separate and complex issues, including the borrowing limits for semi-State companies, a change in the operation of the electricity PSO and the procurement of €350 million of emergency gas generation capacity, I want to state on the record that this is no way to do business.  The main aim of the Bill is to allow EirGrid to procure 450 MW of backup electricity generation capacity to ensure we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. This mismatch in electricity supply and demand is a direct result of failed, incoherent Government policy. The Minister of State very quickly in his 12-minute speech referenced non-delivery of previous contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plant. We could delve into each one of those issues and unpack the policy decisions, assessments, judgments and public signals that were made in regard to them that took us to a very different place than either had been intended or prepared for. We would have to ask how on earth we got to a point where there is a threat of electricity blackouts and we need emergency legislation to literally keep the lights on.  Data centres are at the heart of this problem. They now use as much electricity as all the homes in rural Ireland combined and this is set to at least double by 2030. This is putting huge pressure on our generation capacity and it cannot be consistent with our emissions reduction targets. The last Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres and sought to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with no thought about the impact this would have on our electricity supply or carbon emissions. The current Government has not changed approach, despite our more ambitious climate targets and the increased threat of electricity blackouts and amber alerts. The prospect of amber alerts is now in the common parlance and the vernacular of people in a way that it never was, certainly in my lifetime. Sinn Féin will move an amendment on Committee Stage tomorrow, again calling for a moratorium on the connection of new data centres to the grid. We literally are not in a space where we can be confident that they will not force the lights to go out.  Another reason the Green Party in particular might be keen to rush this legislation through is to gloss over the fact that it is a spending splurge on new fossil fuel infrastructure. This Bill will give EirGrid permission to spend €350 million on new generation capacity, which is likely to come in the form of backup gas-fired generators. Can the Minister of State confirm that €350 million is the ceiling, not the floor, of this expenditure? This spending flies in the face of commitments to move away from fossil fuel infrastructure and will further damage emissions reduction efforts in the energy sector.  In 2021, we saw an increase in our carbon emissions of about 6% and in 2022 we are unlikely to see any reduction either. We are now building new gas generators to ensure we can keep the servers running in data centres. The €350 million for these gas generators could have been used to install solar panels worth €5,000 on 70,000 homes across the State, reducing energy poverty in those homes. That would have reduced electricity bills and provided an income from microgeneration. Instead, it is these very people living in energy poverty who will likely foot the bill for the cost of this extra capacity via higher electricity bills.  How much will be added to household bills based on this proposition? The Minister of State referenced the €75 to be returned to people with the new configuration of the PSO because of the high price of gas, which is welcome, but, on the other side, is there an additional cost to households based on these proposals and, if so, to what extent? Will it offset the €75 that will be returned? Did the Minister of State examine the prospect of requiring large energy users to cover the cost of this backup capacity, given it is not homes in rural Ireland or anywhere else that are causing this demand, and it is largely attributable to data centres? There are a host of unanswered questions which I would like the Minister of State to address in his closing remarks or on Committee Stage tomorrow. As I said, there was no opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Will the Minister of State clarify if this additional capacity will be oil powered or from gas generators, or what form will it take? We have put down an amendment for tomorrow – I would like to see the Minister of State support it - that seeks to ensure priority is given to renewables and to zero or low-carbon options or those that are most easily retrofitted into zero or low-carbon alternatives so there is a prioritisation within the capacity we seek to bring on board. What criteria will have to be met for the new capacity to come into operation? Will this be an option of last resort or will it be scheduled for operation during the winter? Can the Minister of State outline what happens when these generators are no longer needed? Will they be decommissioned and, if so, in what way, will they remain in place as a backup to renewables, or will they be sold on to private energy companies?  The Bill will amend the Turf Development Act 1998 to increase Bord na Móna’s borrowing capacity to €650 million to help it fund its expansion into renewable energy. This is welcome, given the urgent climate crisis. We want to see the State, through semi-State companies, lead the way on investment in renewable energy to ensure the State retains as much ownership as possible of our energy production capacity. We know there is room for the private sector, which has an important role in our energy transition, but we want to see the State lead the way.  In regard to the amendments we will bring forward tomorrow, we will seek to prioritise renewable energy or low carbon backup electricity generation where possible; require EirGrid to have regard to the human rights record of electricity generators with which it enters into agreements; seek to introduce a moratorium on grid connections for new data centres; seek to provide for the sharing of information about the procurement of these additional generators from EirGrid and the CRU with the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action; seek the publication of the energy security review; seek a report into the policy failures of electricity supply and demand that led us to the point where we need to procure emergency additional capacity; and seek a report to be commissioned into the impact that Ireland’s participation in the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT, will have on our path to net zero and whether Ireland will be open to litigation by fossil fuel companies under the provisions of the ECT for taking action to phase out fossil fuels. That is particularly relevant in regard to the potential for lock-in on this new capacity. I would like to hear from the Minister on those matters in the Committee and Report Stage debates.

What I want to do in this amendment is to ensure there is a commitment to consideration of the types of technologies that EirGrid is going to enter into agreement on and procure, and that there should be a prioritisation for technologies that are either renewable, zero carbon or low carbon, or can be transitioned into low carbon alternatives. The point is that they are adaptable and there is a prioritisation within the procurement process. I do not see that elsewhere in the Bill. It is very important that the decisions we make now will bake in emissions into the future. We want to have these technologies. We recognise there is a crisis and we recognise time is important in this regard, but we also need to have an eye on the technologies, so they are zero carbon, low carbon or adaptable into the future.

I hear the Minister's point but it is important to state that the lower emissions alternative must be given priority, and if there is an option to go for hydrogen-ready or technologies that are adaptable, they need to be given priority. Otherwise the decisions the State and EirGrid are going to make will bake in significant challenges for us, regardless of who has ownership of these technologies in the years ahead. I restate that position. I will not press the amendment. I hope the Minister understands my concerns in regard to it.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-29 09:10:00+01:00	EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	5	I echo many of those comments and sentiments from Deputy Smith. We have an amendment grouped with this. I entirely agree that the suggestion that data centres are not a significant part of the issue is complete spin and nonsense. It is disingenuous for anyone to make that statement. In fairness to the Minister of State who was here last night, he pointed to three main reasons we are where we are. One was the non-delivery of previously contracted capacity. We have heard from CRU. CRU had lessons to learn. There should be some investigation into CRU and how it has failed to deliver that capacity and has underestimated demand by almost a factor of four. There are questions to be answered in that regard. Again, this is an issue within the control of Government.  The second point was increasing electricity demand. From where is a significant amount of that increase in electricity demand coming other than data centres? We know that data centres increased their demand by 144% between 2015 and 2020. That figure is from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, not made up by the Opposition for some political reasons. In 2021 alone, data centre demand increased by a further 32%, which puts their usage at about 14% higher than the entire demand from residences in rural Ireland and a significant percentage of all residences in Ireland, including in urban spaces. Data centres are a central part of the consideration.  How we have ended up in this position is a complete misalignment, a failure of policy to match demand with supply. We have runaway demand championed by Governments. Whatever hope we had for a Green Party in government calling a halt and trying to introduce some sense on the issue, we can put paid to after what we heard last night. Going by the Dáil record, the greatest cheerleaders for this data centre policy are among high levels within the Green Party. That tells us everything we need to know about that party.  The amendment we have submitted calls for a pause until such time as the State makes its mind up about what role data centres are going to play, where they should be, what is a reasonable demand to put on our State relative to others, and what role if any they can play in balancing the energy grid. This is about ensuring we have a supply that can match the demand and that does not run the risk of bringing us to a cliff edge or crisis, because this is emergency legislation. Some people tried to deny that last night but it is. It is being rushed through because there is an impending crisis, one successive Governments have managed us towards, and now the Government is seeking the support of the Opposition to bail them out and to look the other way. That is what we are being asked to do.  I ask the Minister to support the Sinn Féin amendment and the others in a similar vein because they make sense. In fact, it is the prudent and sensible thing to do. Our amendment provides for an opportunity to reflect on the current state of affairs and where our energy system might go. We have projections from the Department itself. In March, the Renewable Electricity Corporate Power Purchase Agreements Roadmap was published and it projects the estimated electricity demand in Ireland out to 2030. Residential, commercial and industrial demand stay pretty static between here and 2030 but data centres increase year on year. That is from the Minister's Department, so to suggest this crisis has not been significantly contributed to, if not precipitated, by data centres is a deliberate manoeuvre on behalf of senior figures in Government who should and, I believe, do know better.

When I raise issues with the Minister or the Department, I am often pointed towards a body at arm's length, whether that is the CRU, EirGrid or some other organisation with responsibility. Especially in the context of the CRU, there is always a line in the response that the body is not responsible to the Minister or the Department, but to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. I am a member of that joint committee and I am not satisfied with the CRU's level of accountability in that regard. The other members of the joint committee present can have their say on this subject. For me, that response is a cop-out and I call it out as that.  My amendment provides for an economic, environmental and energy security impact risk analysis, an impact assessment, of current and planned data centres. The Minister is playing with words regarding what has been granted on what dates. Several applications are working their way through the planning process regarding a site in Huntstown in my county. We need to have a real conversation about what is current, what is planned and what will be delivered in economic, environmental and energy security terms. I am not satisfied that the Government is across this issue or that EirGrid, the CRU or any other agency will do it. If past performance is any indicator of future performance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to plough ahead with these projects, and other Departments and other Ministers will look around the place. It is completely unacceptable. At the very least, we need a commitment to an impact assessment.

We dealt with the EirGrid Bill. Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived, under protest, on Second Stage and Committee Stage. We in the Opposition were pontificated to. We were told we had ample time and opportunity to discuss matters but we most certainly had not. Every time we engaged on the Bill, there was additional information. Gaps in the information remain. Not only that but because of the rushed nature of the process, the Government has had to bolt miscellaneous provisions onto the circular economy Bill. The approach taken to the EirGrid Bill, in particular, was not a good way to do legislation and this is another case in point. I wanted to put that on the record as I have on every Stage of that Bill. The same approach has now transferred to the circular economy Bill.  I support the comments made by Deputy Carthy in respect of the perverse situation in which we are left. A crazy set of circumstances has led to a situation whereby products which could be delivered in a circular economy on the island of Ireland are having to be transported over and back to mainland Europe. The effect of that is that the carbon footprint is 48 times more intense and impactful than it would otherwise be. I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene directly. I know he is interested in this and as Deputy Bríd Smith said, the Minister of State has taken on board recommendations from the Opposition in a way I have not seen from other Ministers. I personally appeal to him to intervene in that case, take a personal interest in it and go to County Monaghan.

I want to tease out his response a little. We talk about recycling but what we do in Ireland is collect and separate. We have a small recycling capacity. Shabra Plastics is an example of that in the PET area. Because of the incentives within the market, the subsidies on the one hand and the taxes elsewhere, there is a risk that the small industry in existence will be uncompetitive and will struggle to be sustained. Those levers within the market are disadvantages to companies. There are subsidies for export and virgin plastic taxes elsewhere, which we can introduce but have decided not to on the basis that we want to move as a part of the European Union as a whole. The company in question is affected every working day by the implementation of levies elsewhere. Does the Minister of State see the perfect storm at play here in respect of the industry as it exists? I wish to ask the Minister of State about those two specific measures, the subsidies for export and the virgin plastic taxes elsewhere. How does the Minister of State intend to develop an industry here when the existing industry is struggling because of those measures? Somewhere along the line, the Government is going to have to address these issues or there will be no industry. It will be always more profitable to send products somewhere else, with a massive carbon footprint, to the detriment of local economies in Ireland and certainly to the detriment of the environment. Why do we not address those market anomalies now?

We need to keep an eye on that. The point is that we are subsidising companies here and supporting them financially to export. They are being subsidised to the point that the business model means it is profitable to export. We are not competitive here and we are not competitive in other markets either. This is the solution. If the Government is not going to introduce a virgin plastic tax here, will it take away the subsidy for people to export? It is not recycling; it is exporting for recycling. One cannot be looked at without the other because they are directly related to each other. It is a fundamental point regarding the development of a proper sustainable industry on this island.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2022-07-14 09:00:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	Uber, a company we read knowingly flouted laws, misled people and sold a lie, put a huge effort into influencing transport policy here. It found a sympathetic audience in Fine Gael but, thanks to the resistance of the regulator, it did not succeed. Recently, the Tánaiste opened the door to the company again when he pointed towards the possibility of ride-sharing as a solution to the current constraints in late-night taxi and public transport. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has an ongoing recruitment campaign. It is trying to encourage people into the taxi industry. Fine Gael's cosy relationship with Uber undermines that. The Tánaiste's public utterances matter. Who would invest in a taxi with that cloud hanging over the sector? Will he on behalf of the Government categorically ruled out the introduction of a deregulated Uber-model ride-sharing system here in line with the firm recommendation of the regulator?

I welcome the opportunity to move this Bill on Second Stage. I thank my co-sponsors, Deputies Quinlivan, Cronin and Guirke. I note the Government amendment which states that this Bill will be deemed to have been read a second time this day six months, that is, in January 2023. I understand the rationale for this amendment and hope the Government will have accelerated its planning in the area of green hydrogen by that time and that it will have produced a comprehensive strategy before the new year.   Tuesday of this week saw the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications open a public consultation on the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland. This was very welcome. It goes to the core of what we are debating here today. We brought this Bill forward with the intention of addressing a gap in Government policy with regard to green hydrogen. We sought to be constructive and we are glad to see the Government now moving ahead in line with the intention of our Bill. It is fair to say that the Government has come some way in its thinking on this issue and on the potential opportunity of green hydrogen. That is also welcome.   We believe green hydrogen can play a central role in the decarbonisation of our economy. It is emerging as a sustainable solution for the decarbonisation of many sectors including heavy transport, shipping, aviation and industry. Both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus now have hydrogen buses, which is an exciting development. These buses are filled with hydrogen in a compressed gas state and water is the only by-product emitted through the vehicles' exhaust. I met with Bus Éireann earlier this week and it outlined a positive experience so far with its small hydrogen fleet. This fleet operates on the 105X route, which runs in my constituency of Meath East. Although this area is in its infancy, it highlights the potential applications and benefits of green hydrogen. In the North, Wrightbus is now building hydrogen buses. This highlights the need to plan our hydrogen strategy on an all-island basis, as we have consistently stated.  The hydrogen strategy consultation paper published two days ago further notes that hydrogen is also used in the energy, aerospace, electronics, pharmaceutical and medical industries here, albeit in a limited role. As the technology improves and advances are made, it is important that we are in a position to capitalise on the use of green hydrogen in as many areas as possible in order to help meet our climate targets. Ireland has some of the best offshore wind potential in the world, which affords us the opportunity to become a leader in green hydrogen production through the harnessing of just a portion of this wind energy. This hydrogen can be used domestically to reduce our carbon emissions in line with the national objective of achieving a carbon-neutral economy and society by 2050 or can be sold on international markets as energy, thereby raising revenue for investment in public services here. Ireland has a major opportunity to exploit our wind resource for the production of green hydrogen, which can then be exported to Europe to meet demand. The German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce has already formed a German-Irish hydrogen council in response to the interest expressed in forming closer relationships with Germany in the field of green hydrogen.  Green hydrogen and renewable energy products hold significant potential to create jobs in rural and regional Ireland. This can be seen in the hydrogen-related projects already in the pipeline. Merck's renewable energy division is planning a €200 million green hydrogen plant in Mayo while Bord na Móna has a renewable hub with hydrogen production capabilities planned for the midlands. The ESB's multibillion euro Green Atlantic at Moneypoint plan would see the conversion of the existing coal-fired power station to a renewable energy hub that would include capacity for 1,400 MW of offshore wind, a wind turbine construction base and green hydrogen production and storage facilities. It is great to see ambitious plans like this from semi-State companies. It is exactly the type of State-led investment we have been calling for to ensure we remain in control of vital energy production in the years ahead. Ireland's green hydrogen potential is contingent on the success of our offshore wind sector and there is a significant amount of work to be done in that area. I might come back to that in my closing remarks."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-07-14 09:00:00+01:00	Green Hydrogen Strategy Bill 2022: Second Stage [Private Members]	2	I thank Deputies Quinlivan, Cronin and Guirke for co-sponsoring the Bill. I thank all those who contributed to a good debate tonight. I thank the Minister for being here in person.  There are a number of things to take forward. There are key areas where climate action is clearly in the social and economic interest of people and, of course, in the environmental interest of people and the planet. We need to go after that low-hanging fruit rather than constantly framing climate action as the stick without providing people with alternatives. In key areas, many of them mentioned already, we can empower communities, the regions, rural areas and farmers. There is enormous opportunity in this if it is delivered in the right way. This is an example of that.  The challenge, of course, is that it is so all-encompassing and covers so many fronts that we need the capacity to deliver it. That is why it is essential for Government to prioritise those areas that will return the maximum social, economic and environmental benefit rather than getting into the weeds. There are a number of examples where whole communities and whole sectors locked horns. Invariably people's backs get up and positions become entrenched.  It is essential for Government to prioritise and provide the resources and support to deliver on key objectives because we have not had that experience to date. This area is an example of it more broadly in terms of the offshore wind potential that we have. Sinn Féin has repeatedly raised concerns about the slow pace of our offshore wind energy development and the capacity constraints at planning and other levels within the system. We are not on our own in that regard. As I have discussed with the Minister previously, agencies such as EirGrid, An Bord Pleanála, MARA and the CRU need to be resourced and financed to deliver on the potential that is there, at all times ensuring that systems are robust, comprehensive, biodiversity sensitive and environmentally sensitive.  Deputy Carthy spoke about shortcuts, fast-tracking and bypassing the considerations of communities, and in certain cases bypassing the considerations of the environment requiring us to go back and redo or undo what was done. We need increased efficiency and responsiveness in the planning system, but we must ensure that it does not run roughshod over communities, the environment or biodiversity.  We know there are challenges in terms of the cost of renewables here. If we do not bring down the cost of renewables, green hydrogen will not be a viable commercial proposition. I have raised that issue with the Minister previously. If we are to realise the potential of green hydrogen, we need to look towards a ring-fenced floating offshore renewable electricity support scheme, and there needs to be clear indication in that regard. The industry is stating that there is only a 50-50 chance at this stage - in 2022 - that we will make our 2030 targets in terms of renewables. That is a deep concern. I say that not to score political points or anything like it, but the Government has a responsibility to ensure that the resources and capacity are there. It will have the support of the Opposition if it does that. This approach aligns perfectly with environmental, social and economic objectives. I encourage the Minister and the Government to take said approach rather than getting into the weeds or anywhere else in order to lock horns with individuals or sectors.  As stated, I welcome the Government's engagement on this issue. If the Minister is honest, he will acknowledge that there has been a step change in terms of the position in respect of hydrogen. Several factors have contributed to that, not least the criminal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. That conflict has changed the whole energy landscape and forced everyone to prioritise the opportunities that exist, including those relating to hydrogen. I look forward to engaging further with the Minister on this issue. I encourage people to engage with the public consultation process. There is an emerging sector that will be eager to engage.  This needs to be about more than strategies. We have lots of public consultation, plans and strategies - we need more - but what we need in respect of these is delivery. If the Minister begins to deliver, he will have the support of the Opposition and, I am sure, others.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Broin, Mac Lochlainn, Kerrane and Doherty. This motion sets out a number of proposals that we believe are essential to address the cost-of-living crisis. They are specifically focused on the price of electricity. I call for support for the motion across the House. We need an aggressive and comprehensive response to an unprecedented crisis which is having a significant impact on families and is the most pressing concern for families around the country. We set out in the motion our proposals to cut household electricity bills and cap them at 2021 prices, to introduce cash payments to assist low and middle-income households with their other energy bills, to make a double child benefit payment for every child in recognition of the fact that larger households have greater energy and electricity demands, and, importantly, to introduce a windfall tax in order that excess profits are used for the benefit of our population and people in need. The motion has a number of proposals which will be part of a suite of social welfare and taxation measures that Sinn Féin will propose in our alternative budget in advance of the Government's budget.  In my contribution, I will focus on a couple of aspects, namely, the electricity price cap and the windfall tax. They are intimately related proposals. A clear recognition that the market is broken and must be reformed underpins both proposals. This has been clear for over a year. Gas is being used as a weapon of war. Any of us who have engaged with those working in this sector have had it indicated to us that it was apparent, as far back as this time last year, or earlier, that the tap was being turned by Russia.  The electricity price cap is the right move at the right time. It provides certainty for families who are under huge pressure. It provides a reprieve for families at a time of great pressure and uncertainty. While it is not a permanent solution, it buys time to introduce the sort of systematic reforms that are needed. We have to get the balance of universal measures and targeted measures right. We need to lean towards prioritising targeted measures. As a universal measure, it has the advantage of maintaining the link with usage. It is, in effect, an electricity unit price cap as opposed to an electricity bill price cap. We saw the Government's proposal for a credit being introduced slowly earlier this year. We have seen the various kites flown in recent weeks: it could be a €600 credit over three payments or it could be further beyond that; it would be denied to Travellers in halting sites, as it was before; it would be denied to some living in multi-unit buildings where there is only one meter; and it would be given on the double to people with holiday homes - energy credits will be a bonanza for those people. That proposal from the Government has the same weaknesses that it always had. It goes hand in hand with a windfall tax, individual and important elements to address a broken market, and the super-excess and crisis-related profits of energy companies. There are two parts to any windfall tax, which are the huge profits being made by energy generators, which the European Union refers to as a solidarity tax, and the huge windfall that arises for renewable companies because of the pegging of gas prices to electricity prices. The suggestion that Sinn Féin is at risk of writing a blank cheque to energy companies is the greatest bluff of them all, especially coming from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who are the parties that sold off our gas assets. Vermilion Energy reported a 267% increase in Corrib profits between 2020 and 2021. In the second quarter of this year, the parent company recorded €214 million in profits, up 28% year on year. That was all sold off to the private interests. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael also sold off our gas utility companies, deregulated the market and, as they did with so many things, treated energy as a commodity not as a right and a utility. This Government fought for a year against reforms of the EU energy market. Why? It was to protect the profits of the energy companies in the hope, nothing more, that they would invest those profits in new energy infrastructure, some of which was hoped would be renewables. We missed the opportunity of the Iberian exemption, despite having a real opportunity to make the exact same case. This Government has a clear track record of not doing enough. The Sinn Féin proposals contained in tonight's motion point in the right direction.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-15 09:00:00+01:00	An Bord Pleanála: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I will focus on the need to improve An Bord Pleanála as it has an important role in this State realising its renewable potential, in particular at this time its offshore wind potential. We know that we have a great resource in this State and there is a long-term potential of 70 GW of ocean energy opportunity from wind, wave and tidal sources. Unfortunately, decades of under-ambition and painfully slow regulatory advancement has suffocated the development of this natural resource. This is highlighted by the fact that we have just one small wind farm currently in operation. The climate crisis, our energy security concerns, and the skyrocketing costs of light and heat reinforce the need to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind potential. The European Union has encouraged countries to ensure that their planning systems and authorities are sufficiently resourced to deliver on decisions on these projects as quickly as possible and that they should receive priority.  We need to ensure that offshore projects that are now planned are not unduly delayed due to Government inaction, that they are robustly scrutinised to assess the biodiversity and environmental impact and that communities have an opportunity to have their say. I would like to see that as many of those projects as possible are State-owned or led or community-owned or led. We need timely decisions which do not necessarily need to be quick but agreed ones.   We need proper statutory timeframes that are enforced and adhered to. We have statutory objectives but they are being missed by a country mile. For example, in decisions on planning appeals for renewables projects, of the ten planning appeals cases taken to An Bord Pleanála, none were decided within the 18-week statutory objective. The average time for a decision was 60 weeks and the average time for the board inspectors to make a recommendation was 35 weeks.  On strategic infrastructure development, SID, applications, of the three SID applications heard by the board, none were decided within the 18-week statutory objective and the average time for decision was 69 weeks. The average time for the board inspectors to make a recommendation was 47 weeks. That is completely inadequate.   As for achieving those timelines, I am aware of the deep frustration and I hear from State agencies and private developers that their deep concern is not so much with the prospect of getting a refusal but is of the inordinate delay in obtaining a decision one way or the other. Those statutory timelines need to be adhered to and to do that, they need to be resourced. We know that it is the case that An Bord Pleanála's marine and climate unit is significantly under-resourced. This is an issue I have raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on numerous occasions, which is the resourcing of An Bord Pleanála, our planning authorities, but also the wider planning system, including the notified bodies whether that be through BirdWatch Ireland, the Irish Environmental Network, and the agencies and NGOs that it supports. The system needs to be provided with the resources and the capacity to do its job in a timely manner.  That brings me to my final point on the need, which is committed to in the programme for Government, for a planning and environmental court. This commitment in that programme is to establish a new planning and environmental law court managed by specialist judges and on the same basis as the existing commercial court model. I understand that there are ongoing discussions taking place with the Department of Justice on that and as to how it might work. It will have a very important role, particularly to bring Ireland in line with its European and international obligations. That is something the Minister should take on board and ensure that it happens.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-15 09:00:00+01:00	Security of Electricity Supply: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this comprehensive motion. It allows us an opportunity to talk about the crucial issue of energy security. It is important to get into the weeds on this issue and to pick apart the details. I say this because, in many respects, the Government has tried as much as possible to confuse the situation and to wrap it up in the context of events in Ukraine, internationally or in the EU. I refer to the truth of all this, though, particularly concerning energy security and the risk of blackouts. We heard the regulator speaking on the radio this morning and again confirming that it cannot be guaranteed there will not be blackouts this winter. This is a direct result of policy failure by successive Governments. It is entirely in the gift of the Government and it is also an essential responsibility to ensure that we have energy security.  There was a complete mismanagement of supply and demand. The red carpet was rolled out for data centres even as electricity demand increased year-on-year. There was a 12% increase over five years. My county and others saw an enormous roll-out of these data centres. This was one aspect of the situation. Another aspect, however, is that to have done this at a time when the Government was also failing to deliver capacity on the supply side was reckless and dangerous. It puts lives and livelihoods at risk. This is an incredible failure of policy and of the business of Government.  At the request of Sinn Féin, representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and EirGrid appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action in recent weeks to discuss this subject. That was because over the summer recess people were reading on the front pages of their newspapers about leaked reports and details in reports of disaster planning scenarios that put the fear of God in them, to be honest. It was confirmed by the representatives of EirGrid that we are at a heightened risk of experiencing blackouts this winter. The Minister outlined some of the emergency measures being put in place to try to address this potentiality. There is a question mark over every one of those measures in respect of the existing back-up capacity and the ability of those batteries, optimised or otherwise. Therefore, there is risk and it is significant in this regard. This is something that can be laid entirely at the door of the Minister.  Something else that did not get much attention because it was technical legislation was the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 that was rushed through in an emergency manner just before the Dáil rose for the summer recess. In real terms, that was a rewriting of the rule book in respect of the procurement of back-up generation. It was a damning indictment of the CRU, EirGrid, the Department and the Minister and the capacity to deliver essential electricity supply. It came years after red flags had been raised and alarm bells sounded in this regard. We failed to deliver capacity for the winters of 2021 and 2022. As far as I can see, the regulator and the transmission operator were standing looking at each other, bickering and pointing the finger at each other. It is the responsibility of the Government and the Minister of the day to ensure that these systems operate and that these agencies and regulators are operating to a standard. All this falls back on a failure of Government policy.  We also see this in the context of the delivery of supply and the planning system, which is completely unfit for purpose. We have targets for 2030, and they have been increased. Every time the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has to launch a document, I believe he wants to be able to say we are increasing our ambition in the area of renewables. They fail to meet any one of those targets. That is what will continue to happen unless the Government invests in the planning and regulatory system. If one looks at An Bord Pleanála, and I spoke about it earlier, the applications that go in have a target timeline of 18 weeks but it is turning around decisions on planning appeals in 60 weeks. On strategic infrastructure development, SID, applications, the target time is 18 weeks but it is turning around decisions in 69 weeks. The system is completely broken. Those decisions that are delayed today will have an impact in winter 2027, winter 2028 and winter 2029. Will we still be wondering about blackouts in those years as well because of a failure of Government to deliver on its obligations?  It has been mentioned repeatedly in relation to microgeneration of solar. It is incredible. There are communities, whether it be the GAA, community centres or businesses, putting their hands up in the middle of an energy crisis to install solar photovoltaic, PV, and they have hurdle after hurdle put in front of them. I want to bring to the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth's attention a particular problem at this point in time, among all the other ones, with the better energy community scheme, and ask that he take a note of it. I have been on to the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the Minister about it. There are a number of applications in to be assessed and as far as I can gather from listening to applicants, the goalposts are being shifted and the promise of updated regulations and updated exemptions in terms of planning puts a number of really important applications in jeopardy. It is something that needs to be reviewed.  Central to this debate in terms of energy security is the approach that successive Governments have taken in relation to the energy system. I look back to the 1916 Proclamation and at the ownership of our natural resources and the use of them for the people of Ireland. Successive Governments, largely Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, have sold them off, often not even to the highest bidder. We look at the profits of the owner of the Corrib Gas Field. I stood at Corrib gas, with others and with the local community at that time. If one looks at the profits of Vermilion, it reported 267% increased profits last year. This year, it is reporting a 28% increase in profits. These are spectacular numbers. Those who will get the benefit of that are the company's shareholders, not, as it should be, the people of Ireland. That is all on the shoulders of successive Governments.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-15 09:00:00+01:00	Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I support the comments made by Deputy Ó Broin. I will focus my comments, from my perspective as environment spokesperson and someone living in County Meath, on the importance of Uisce Éireann having a programme of work and seeking to deliver on that programme of work for communities and for our environment because we know that we have very particular challenges in infrastructure deficit in water and wastewater. That has an impact on planning and there is a great need to ensure there is alignment between county development plans and critical infrastructure priority programmes for water and wastewater, among other things. We are not there and it is a problem.   We see where the deficit or lag in delivery of water and wastewater infrastructure has an impact on development. I am someone who supports compact growth and transport-led development but where it does not happen or happens poorly, it is very problematic for people who have to live with it.  I will mention a number of projects in my own county that are at various stages of development and progress. In Ratoath, with a population that has seen very significant growth over recent years, the Windmill Hill reservoir and the replacement of the existing water mains needs to be a major priority. I would encourage the Minister, Uisce Éireann and the Department to ensure that it is delivered as a priority. It is working its way through the system. We have had very many water outages in recent times because the infrastructure is literally creaking at the seams and needs to be replaced and upgraded. I welcome that there is a commitment in regard to investment but we need to fast-track these projects and have them delivered.  This is similarly the case with Stamullen wastewater treatment plant and Kells wastewater treatment plant. That is an area I know and I commend the local angling community, the custodians of the water network, who do such great work as they are the first people who contact you if there are leakages, contamination or environmental harm or damage. They will spot it straightaway. I find so often that they are not adequately supported in that role. Kells wastewater treatment plant is on a long list of projects due a network upgrade but it needs to be advanced. We have seen from various Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports over the years that this is a project that was a priority but was pushed back and various intermediate or interim measures were taken to push it back even further. We need to see that work done.   Finally, I again commend the work of angling and community groups in my constituency and in the neighbouring constituencies of Louth and Meath East. The Save the Boyne group has emerged in response to what I believe is an offensive planning proposal for a meat processing plant that will discharge wastewater into the Boyne. The group has sought an oral hearing from An Bord Pleanála and has been denied that. I believe that is the wrong decision and I will continue to make that case. I commend that group for its activism in opposition to this planning application but, far broader than that, for its work to support and protect the Boyne. It is very encouraging to see that type of environmental activism. I commend it for that work and will continue to support it and the call for an oral hearing.

I am sharing time with Deputies Tully, Martin Kenny, Ó Murchú, Gould, Clarke and Ellis.  The Government's retrofitting plan was announced to great fanfare in February but it was clear from the start that it was deeply unfair. This should come as no surprise given who designed it. This winter Deputies can access retrofitting quicker than two pensioners burning coal to heat one room. That is deeply unfair. It is not right. The Government's plan needs to be overhauled. We need a plan at a time of crisis that is targeted, based on need not ability to pay, flexible and responsive and one that will be rolled out rapidly and efficiently.  The Government has stated that 58% of its retrofitting budget is going to energy poverty schemes but the truth is queues are getting longer and budgets are not being spent. In fact, the Government is siphoning off money to pay for diesel back-up generators. The Government's retrofitting plan is deeply inequitable. It fails the equity test and the just transition test.  I will make a number of points of specific criticism. People who need retrofits - those living in the coldest and poorest homes - cannot access them. For people who are eligible for schemes, more than 9,000 homes are on waiting lists for works under the better energy warmer homes scheme, with a wait time of 27 months, which is getting longer. Otherwise, strict criteria mean that people are not eligible for schemes and they do not have the upfront money. They cannot put their hands on the money. People who have less need - those living in warmer homes - can access retrofits because they have access to funds. There is wait of greater than two years or a closed door, on the one hand, while, on the other, there is access based on ability to pay. This approach certainly fails the equity test.  There is a shortage of workers and those workers are, as a result, being inefficiently deployed to demand-led, random houses here and there. Contractors say they have never been more burdened with paperwork and bureaucracy. People who want to access individual grants are being denied because of upfront costs. The bureaucracy involved means budgets will be unspent. As I mentioned, €40 million has already been siphoned off this year's retrofitting budget.  In solar photovoltaic, PV, people face barrier after barrier. There is significant potential here. On solid fuel, people have been browbeaten over turf but no alternatives have been provided.  Sinn Féin’s plan would address all of these issues and it would do it without increasing carbon taxes. We would invest €503 million in retrofits in 2023. That is €153 million more than the Government's 2022 allocation – the outturn will be far less - and far ahead of its 2023 capital allocation. That money would be spent in a far fairer and more efficient way.  Sinn Féin would take a targeted, plan-led and area-based approach based on need rather than ability to pay. It would cluster houses together with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, as the lead agency working hand in hand with local authorities and other housing agencies and with one-stop shop contractors acting as delivery vehicles, commissioned by local authorities, the SEAI and private individuals, driving competition within the one-stop shop system and reducing costs. As we grow the workforce through expanded dedicated training in education and training boards, ETB, programmes, this area-based, plan-led approach would use existing resources efficiently and effectively. We would prioritise existing applicants on the better energy warmer homes scheme but we would replace that programme, broaden eligibility criteria for those on higher incomes and dedicate an additional €73 million to that. Works would be subsidised on a tiered basis based on income. We would also provide a 50% increase in funding for local authority housing, which would protect those most at risk of poverty and fuel poverty and the impact of the rising cost of energy.  Acting on the call of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the hundreds of thousands of people who are excluded from individual grants because they do not have the upfront costs, we would ensure that applications for individual grants, for example, for attic and cavity wall insulation, are assessed quickly and that upfront grant payments are made. We are in a time of crisis. The money needs to get out as quickly as possible and contractors need to be put to work.  We also have proposals for a dedicated scheme for those on solid fuel and additional spending on solar PV. We have a clear plan. The Minister needs to change tack and support the Sinn Féin motion."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-20 14:00:00+01:00	National Retrofit Plan: Motion [Private Members]	2	I thank those who have contributed to this debate. It is notable that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael could present a speaker. Maybe they do not see the same problems that we do. Maybe they do not represent the same constituents that we do, namely, those who are struggling to access these schemes and to heat their homes this winter.  I have to say in response to the Government contribution that we are setting out a clear challenge to the Government. We have identified weaknesses in the schemes, as the Minister heard from a number on the Opposition benches. We need the Government to increase funding. We need to reorient the schemes to ensure they are targeted to those in need, those on low and middle incomes and those in local authority houses. The schemes need to be targeted based on need. There are far too many excluded from the schemes based on waiting lists, on strict eligibility criteria or on the inability to pay, given that they do not have the upfront funding to access the necessary grants. I have not heard enough in response from the Government to be confident it is hearing exactly what has been said here, or that it is going to respond to address the barriers and the lack of flexibility. There is a need to address the roll-out and the speed of lower-cost or shallower retrofits.  I am very concerned by what I hear. The Minister of State gave a lot of information and figures benchmarked against last year, which was in the middle of Covid. It is no great achievement to do better than last year and to have that as a starting point. My understanding is that the overall target is 27,900. The Minister of State indicated that this is now at 13,400, but that just 4,200 of those are to B2 or B2 equivalent. That is a very low number and is of real concern. In that regard, I wonder is that the same as last year. Are many of those B2 or B2 equivalents the result of a move from C1 by just putting solar panels on the roof, and that is another one off the list? That is not the type of progress we need to see.  We need targeted investment towards people who are going to struggle to heat their homes, who are living in cold homes, who are poor. They need to be prioritised, not Deputies, Senators, wealthy people or people who have a spare €25,000. We will get to them but they are not literally at the coal face this winter. The schemes need to be reoriented and they need to be prioritised. Workers are busy retrofitting the homes of wealthy people. We need to take that resource, because we do not have enough of those workers and contractors, and we need to put them where they are needed and, in the first instance, to address the long waiting lists and to expand those schemes. Our approach is one that is efficient and effective. It is about identifying the needs with the SEAI and local authorities and then working through blocks of houses in groups.  The Government is not opposing the motion. I would rather that it took our motion and ran with it, reformed the schemes and delivered for people in need.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:12:00+01:00	Energy Security: Motion [Private Members]	1	We have an energy and security crisis because of gross mismanagement by successive Governments, particularly in the last decade. Principally, therefore, the responsibility lies with the Fine Gael party, it having been a continuing feature of Governments in that period. There has been gross mismanagement. This is a matter of energy supply and demand. Those Governments rolled out the red carpet for data centres, which have huge energy demand. At the same time, they Governments failed time and again to deliver on supply. Data centres have a role, but we must be able to power them.  There have been so many failures at different times, including policy failures and failures of action. This has led us to a situation where we have had more amber alerts in this calendar year than we have had in most of the previous decade. This has been a failure of successive Governments to plan, prepare, execute and deliver. It has also been a failure of agencies. The CRU has failed to deliver at several auctions. It is almost a case of trial and error with CRU. It tries to secure energy power plants and it fails. It tries again and fails again. Earlier this year, before the Dáil rose for the summer recess, the Government had to rewrite the rulebook in the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 because the CRU and other State agencies had failed to procure the necessary energy power plants to get us through last winter, this winter and the winters of 2023, 2024 and 2025.   This has implications for the price of energy. It puts an extra €40 on people's bills each year. The other thing the Government did in that legislation was to take so-called ring-fenced carbon tax revenues, intended to be used to retrofit poor people's homes, to spend them on buying diesel generators. It could not deliver gas generators, so now it is going to deliver diesel generators. This is the same CRU whose representatives told the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action yesterday that there was nothing the agency could do regarding standing charges and it would not even suggest that families be put on the lowest tariff. It is a case of kid gloves from the Minister, the Government and the agencies.  Another responsible agency is EirGrid. Its representatives presented at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action we had called to address this crisis and stated that a 9% increase in energy demand over the past five years was not excessive. Those were the words used. When we asked the CRU how a 9% increase in energy demand here compared with other countries, such as the EU 27, Switzerland and Norway, it indicated that the demand increase experienced in those countries in the past five years was 0%. Yet, it also stated that a 9% increase was not excessive, as we face into a winter of amber alerts, possible red alerts and a real increase in the risk of blackouts. This is no joke for families as they head into the winter.  The State has also failed to deliver alternatives, whether it be gas storage as a back-up or renewables. Regarding planning delays, wind energy groups have said there is supposed to be an 18-week turnaround time for decisions on planning applications but it is more like 60 weeks for planning appeals for strategic infrastructure developments. Just today, it was reported that we do not have a single port in the Twenty-six Counties that will be fit to facilitate the building of offshore wind facilities, yet we are supposed to be delivering 7 GW of offshore wind energy generation by 2030. It is not going to happen under this Government, and this is of deep concern.  It is the same with the energy security review, which has been long-awaited and was published earlier this week. It is a waste of money because it was very clear to anybody observing this area for any length of time that we needed to address the energy security crisis we have and that we needed gas storage. The Government needs to get on with this work, rather than dithering. The energy security review is a perfect example of that dithering. It has moved into a public consultation. The Government should get on with the work.

If it was only Donegal that did not have rail, we might be in a far better starting position. Unfortunately, there are many other counties in the same boat as Donegal. Many people will be familiar with the map that compares the rail network today with the rail network 100 years ago. It is an incredible shame that we are where we are now and have lost that fantastic infrastructure that would serve us so well.  The OECD will release a report today or in the coming days that will reflect on Ireland’s approach to transport and the Government’s approach to transport policy. It will be critical of the Government's decision to place so many eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. It is well known at this stage that the target of 1 million EVs is a fantasy target and meaningless. If Government had sense, it would just walk away from that, for many reasons.   The many reasons for expanding the public transport network have already been articulated in terms of climate, social benefits, inclusivity, health and economics. A public transport network is like a good education system; it is a great social equaliser.  Sinn Féin produced a set of proposals. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and I thank Deputy Pringle for tabling the motion. We need the Government to be aggressive and ambitious in the roll-out of public transport. It needs to involve more than reports and targets. Communities need to see delivery to ensure they have a public transport system that is accessible, affordable, available, meets their needs and works for them. That is the standard. It needs to make sense for people. If the public transport option does not make sense for people, they will not use it. In many cases, they will not use it because they cannot use it; it is not affordable, accessible and available to them.  Sinn Féin set out a suite of proposals. I understand from the budget discussions that the Government is considering many options. We want to set out what we want the Government to do and what we would do if we were in government. We would make the 20% public transport fare reductions permanent, not just extend them to the end of next year. We would make them permanent and expand them to private bus operators. Whether it is Suirway in the south east, Buggy Coaches in Kilkenny or, in my area, Ashbourne Connect, these are services that are either dropping or reducing their services because they cannot compete. We would cut public transport fares by 50% for those under 18 to encourage positive habit formation. We would make public transport more accessible for people with disabilities by investing €12.6 million in the public transport accessibility retrofit programme. We would do that every year for a term in government bringing the total in that fund to €137 million. That would, in a five-year term, make all public transport fully accessible.  The Minister of State has heard the stories of people having to wait 24 hours or having to send a notification and about lifts not working and public transport services not being accessible. That needs to be addressed. We would accelerate the roll-out of rural bus services. There is a good plan in Connecting Ireland and there is a real demand for it. However, the funding is not there. It is a five-year €56 million programme, with €5 million invested in the first year, and we do not know what will come in subsequent years. Sinn Féin would put €25 million into that programme this year. The Government should do the same. In 2023, we need communities to see new services they can access at an affordable rate.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-05 09:10:00+01:00	Communications Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Communications Regulation Bill is a technical piece of legislation but one with important implications for telecommunications providers and their customers. The primary aim of the Bill is to transpose the European electronic communications code and the EU-wide regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector. This Bill aims to provide ComReg with stronger regulatory and consumer protection powers, which is very welcome. ComReg's most recent annual report highlights that it received approximately 79,000 contacts from customers over a 12-month period, highlighting the demand placed on the regulator from consumers and the need for robust powers to ensure high standards are met in the telecoms sector.  The following comments are not unique to Eir but, some time ago, the communications committee called Eir in front of it to address the high level of complaints about its standard of customer service. ComReg told us at that time that 65% of all complaints made to the regulator were from Eir customers. This chimed with the incredible amount of correspondence we received as Deputies and local councillors from people who had a dreadful customer service experience with that company. The level of anger and frustration from people who dealt with Eir and who got in touch at the time of the hearing was off the scale - it was really quite remarkable, from old to young and in all parts of the country. Eir apologised at the committee and committed to improving its service but the entire saga highlighted how weak the regulator was. In truth, ComReg has been operating with one hand tied behind its back, which has allowed poor standards and customer service problems to go unaddressed.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-06 09:00:00+01:00	Communications Regulation Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)	1	I will be sharing time with colleagues.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has been operating with one hand tied behind its back, which has allowed poor standards and customer service problems to go unaddressed. As in the energy sector, the Government established an independent regulator but left it without the teeth needed to enforce standards of quality properly. At the time, we called for the introduction of legislation to provide for much larger sanctions that would act as a deterrent to communications companies treating their customers with contempt. Here we are two years on. The Bill is better late than never, though, and I welcome its provisions and recognise the effort to ensure due diligence in terms of providing ComReg with the necessary powers to clamp down on poor standards and behaviour among communications companies.  I will mention another regulator that falls under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and is operating without enough powers, namely, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. It has a number of questions to answer, but some of the problems fall at the Minister's door. A couple of weeks ago, the CRU confirmed to the climate committee that it lacked the legislative remit to govern standing charges. This means that utility companies can hike their standing charges without having to prove to anyone that there has been a corresponding increase in their fixed costs. It is a recipe for disaster. Despite households decreasing their energy usage, they are now being stung for more money via higher standing charges. This behaviour from energy companies will not help to encourage lower energy use in normal times. The Minister needs to address this. He should introduce emergency legislation to give the regulator the power to regulate standing charges and beef up its consumer protection abilities.  We recently learned that domestic electricity customers had paid €600 million over the past decade to subsidise large energy users' costs. This was an incredible revelation in the   Returning to the Bill, ComReg was established 20 years ago, so it is well past time that it be given proper enforcement powers. ComReg has a wide and important remit over a large number of companies in the telephone, mobile, broadband and broadcasting sectors. The current legislation requires ComReg to pursue civil and criminal sanctions through the courts. In transposing the European electronic communications code, EECC, this Bill will establish a new civil enforcement regime for ComReg, which will allow ComReg to make declarations of non-compliance and impose a range of penalties instead of having to apply to the High Court. This is a positive move, as I hope it can speed up these processes and not leave them caught in the court system for years. It is proposed that the penalties can include administrative financial sanctions up to a maximum of €5 million or 10% of annual turnover, up from the current maximum of €500,000, which simply does not act as a strong enough deterrent for multimillion euro - sometimes multibillion euro - companies in these sectors. Providing ComReg with enhanced enforcement powers, particularly the power to find non-compliance and impose administrative financial sanctions, would bring the regulator further in line with equivalent regulatory bodies in the State.  The Bill would also provide for ComReg to set minimum quality of service standards in the areas of customer service, complaint handling, switching, billing and refunds. I hope that this will address the problems that many people face when trying to get simple answers from, and issues resolved by, phone, TV, mobile and broadband providers. As acknowledged by the Minister of State, it can often take an age to get answers to simple questions and resolving straightforward technical issues can be a mammoth task when dealing with certain communication companies. There is no excuse for this. It is causing particular issues for people who are now working from home and are more reliant on their phones and broadband. Some people dread ringing telecoms companies because they can spend hours on the phone and still not get their problems resolved. Introducing minimum quality of service standards in this area will help to change the bad behaviour of some companies that show contempt for their customers.  One of the most annoying issues for mobile and email users is the constant stream of scam calls, text messages and emails. These are getting more sophisticated and advanced and can result in people losing thousands of euro. People are now receiving text messages with fraudulent links attached in the midst of the thread of legitimate messages from their banks. Others are plagued with scam phone calls and spam emails. Victims of text message scams were cheated out of an average of €1,700 during the first half of 2022 according to figures from FraudSMART, the fraud awareness initiative from Banking & Payments Federation Ireland. I understand that an industry-led task force, facilitated by ComReg, has been established to identify and recommend practical interventions that might be taken by operators in the short, medium and long terms to combat nuisance communications. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, might provide an update on this work.  The Minister of State will be aware that the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against Ireland over the Government's failure to transpose the EECC within the required timeframe. Will he update the House on whether this has resulted in financial penalties being levied and how much has been spent on the State's legal defence since Ireland was referred to the European Court of Justice in April?  I welcome the introduction of the Bill. It is vital that our regulators have the powers needed to protect consumers and clamp down on poor standards among some providers. I look forward to dealing with the particulars of the Bill on Committee Stage. I note the number of amendments from the Minister that were late additions, particularly those relating to the Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003. I will discuss them with my colleagues and I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State on them.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 14:00:00+01:00	Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	"There is a sense of  A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done. There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon. With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year. Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly. Unfortunately, the Government ignored the constructive proposals from the Opposition, as is so often the case, and rejected all the amendments. As a result another piece of primary legislation has had to be drafted and rammed through the parliamentary process in an uncomfortably quick timeframe. I ask the Minister to take on board some of the Opposition’s amendments this time around. Those amendments cover a number of areas.  The broad, blunt nature of the original electricity credit Bill gave rise to a number of issues that we asked to be rectified. Those included people being excluded from the payment altogether, households with a shared meter not receiving the full amount and people with vacant holiday homes, empty houses or multiple properties receiving a number of payments. With almost 12 months to prepare and re-prepare this legislation, it is inexcusable that none of these issues seem to have been adequately addressed. People with holiday homes lying idle for most of the year will now get even more money to help keep the lights on. The most recent census identified 61,204 holiday homes in the State. It is outrageous that these vacant holiday homes have still not been excluded from this scheme. On top of the previous €200, they will now get another €600. That is a total of almost €50 million of taxpayers' money to keep the lights on in the second homes of predominantly well-off individuals. It is an atrocious waste of money. Yet again, those with the greatest means will benefit most while those in severe energy poverty will get the same support as a millionaire.  Similarly, people living in halting sites or in mobile homes were excluded from the original payment. We repeatedly asked for that to be addressed in recent months. The briefing note we received, which was reflected in the Minister's comments, states that approximately 1,000 Traveller households in local authority accommodation were excluded from the original payment. It goes on to say the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how best to reach these households with future support. That is simply not good enough. It is eight months since the original scheme was introduced. Some of these households are living in extreme energy poverty and need immediate assistance. Saying that we are working on it is not good enough. The Minister needs to commit to ensuring these families will receive the full €600 this winter on top of the €200 they did not get originally. If the Departments cannot find a way to do this, they should give the money to local authorities or groups like the National Traveller Money Advice & Budgeting Service and ask them to distribute cash payments to these households. It is essential that they get immediate support to help cover their electricity bills.  A number of Sinn Féin amendments to this Bill seek to prevent disconnections of pay-as-you-go customers. The Government has been caught asleep at the wheel on this issue. Despite 346,000 households using prepay meters, the Government has no plan and seems to be making it up as it goes along. The Taoiseach went on national radio a couple of weeks ago and assured people they would not be disconnected this winter, but the Government did not have a plan for pay-as-you-go households. Last week, when my colleague an Teachta Doherty raised this on Leaders' Questions, the Tánaiste threw the ball back to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and said that the latter was meeting with energy companies to come up with a solution. Meanwhile, pay-as-you-go customers are none the wiser as they face into a dreadfully unaffordable winter.  The Minister must commit to extending the moratorium on disconnections to all pay-as-you-go customers. They should not have any less protection than bill pay customers. It is simply a matter of fairness and equality. Whether this is achieved by increasing the emergency credit limit, removing the limit altogether, extending the so-called friendly credit period when disconnections do not take place or moving people to bill pay without financial penalties, the Minister can pursue a number of options. This should have been done already. In addition, we want to see the moratorium for all households extended from now to the end of March; December to February is not enough. We are in a time of extraordinary price increases, so much greater protections are needed.  Sinn Féin has made its position clear . We believe an electricity price cap is needed this winter to give households certainty. We need to reduce electricity prices back to pre-crisis levels and cap them. Price caps have been introduced right across Europe but the Government has chosen a different path of giving three energy credits this winter. Although we disagree with this approach, we will support the Bill because the €550 in electricity credits will still help offset some costs for people this winter.  EU energy reforms are badly needed. Last October, the Government opposed proposals at EU level to decouple electricity prices from the gas market. At that time, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications co-signed a statement to the effect that ""we cannot support any measure that conflicts with the internal gas and electricity market"". Currently, the price of gas is dictating the price of all electricity, which is pushing electricity prices to extortionate levels. The energy market is fundamentally broken and needs to be radically reformed. While I welcome the Minister’s recent change of heart and his newfound support for decoupling gas from electricity prices, his conversion came very late in the day and a lot of time has been wasted on this front. Can he provide an update on the proposals to decouple at a European level and provide some details on how much Ireland could expect from the windfall tax on non-gas-fuelled electricity generators? Why is the rate of €180 per megawatt hour being considered, given the much lower cost of producing electricity by wind and solar or other renewable sources? Will the Government look to introduce a lower rate? We accept that renewable energy companies still need to a make a profit to reinvest in renewables, but pegging electricity prices to another inflated price is not a good solution.  Another matter that is pushing bills to unaffordable levels is the increase in standing charges utility companies are announcing. Some energy companies have increased their standing charges by €300 in the past year, thereby compounding the financial hardship people are facing. Suppliers are now charging up to €700 a year in standing charges, which is a massive cost before people even switch on a light. The CRU confirmed to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action a couple of weeks ago that no one is regulating the hikes in standing charges and that it lacks the legislative remit to deal with these charges. It seems that energy companies have free rein to hike standing charges by as much as they want without having to justify it to anyone, or prove a corresponding increase in their fixed costs. It is an absolutely crazy situation. Given the energy price crisis households are facing, every line of their bills must be tackled. Will the Minister commit to introducing legislation or regulations to give the CRU the power to regulate standing charges on energy bills?  I will touch on the revelation last week that domestic electricity customers have been subsidising the energy bills of large energy users for the past decade without anyone seemingly knowing. The Minister, during his stint as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2010, introduced the large energy user rebalancing subvention. Since then, ordinary households have paid €600 million to subsidise the bills of big companies. This is an extraordinary revelation. The subvention in question did not appear as a line item on people’s bills, so no one was aware they were paying this levy. Can the Minister explain why this charge was never removed on domestic bills, the companies that benefited and how long he intended it to be in place when he originally introduced it? These are important details that need to be known.  We will support this Bill but hold the position that reducing electricity prices to pre-crisis levels, and capping them at that cost this winter, is a better solution and will give households much greater certainty. Reform of the energy market is needed. It was needed 12 months ago when this Government opposed it and it is still needed now. A windfall tax on non-gas electricity generators and a solidarity windfall tax on energy companies should also be introduced. I also encourage the Minister of State to look at the amendments tabled by the Opposition and commit to supporting them."

We have articulated previously that the Government’s approach is not the one we would have taken. There are always strengths and weaknesses with universal measures, and a number of the weaknesses of this approach would not arise with the introduction of a cap on prices. There are particular weaknesses to this approach and many of them relate to the fact that it is not targeted, that there are anomalies within it and that some cohorts are excluded and disadvantaged by it while others are advantaged. Perversely, those who are in the greatest need, as is often the case, are the ones who are disadvantaged.  We again heard on Second Stage that the issue of Travellers on halting sites who share one meter point reference number, MPRN, has not been resolved. During that debate, the Minister of State indicated this applies to about 1,000 people. That should be resolved and there is no excuse for it not yet having been. We have raised this issue repeatedly in committee, including in front of some of his colleagues such as the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, when the underspend on the previous scheme was being diverted to buy diesel generators and it was acknowledged this was an issue. It was acknowledged as an issue months ago, yet still there has been no resolution. Their party colleagues will acknowledge it as an issue when they appear in the media but nothing moves. We need clarity on how this scheme and the previous one will be directed towards Travellers on halting sites.  The same goes for renters and people who live in communal heating or local district heating accommodation, as well as those living in multi-unit accommodation with just one meter. Having seen representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and others appear before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on repeated occasions, I believe there is an underwhelming level of energy, enthusiasm and engagement regarding these challenges. It is clear what needs to be done. As in the case of our energy poverty strategy, we need to identify those people who need the support and provide mechanisms to give that targeted support. If we did that, we would be in a position to address some of the anomalies in this universal measure.  The flip side of this, of course, is that people who have holiday homes, perhaps Deputies, Senators and other high-income earners, do very well out of this and, as has been said, get a benefit, sometimes on the double, treble or quadruple, depending on how many properties they have, that they do not need in relative terms. It is that disproportionality in the relative impact of this cost-of-living and energy crisis that is not reflected in this measure. The mechanism in this amendment would go some way towards addressing that when we next come to this position.  Another group, of course, who need to be protected in this space are people who use pay-as-you-go meters. Again, as in the case of the CRU and the Minister of State's colleagues when they appear in the media, there is an acknowledgement that there is a particular set of challenges, but when it comes to finding a solution, there is none to be found. We heard this again today from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is simply not good enough. We tabled a number of amendments that sought to achieve a greater targeting and protection for people who are more exposed but they were ruled out of order. We had specific amendments relating to pay-as-you-go meters. While this legislation may not be the place to resolve that, it absolutely needs to be resolved somewhere. We never hear the reason amendments have been ruled out of order, but the Government needs to provide, in clear terms, a solution for people who use these meters. We have spelled that solution out, as we did in an amendment that was ruled out of order. The Government can implement it, if not in this legislation then in the real world. It can extend the friendly credit and ensure there will be the same protections for pay-as-you-go meter users as there are for bill-pay meter users. If a bill-pay meter user does not have the funds to pay his or her bill, the lights and the gas will stay on, whereas for a pay-as-you-go meter user, that is not the case. That needs to be resolved and there are a number of ways that could happen, such as by extending the friendly credit or the emergency credit or by ensuring that anybody who wants to be transferred to a bill-pay meter can do so free of charge, not just the vulnerable cohorts. The Government needs to act on that because there are deeply unfair implications and consequences arising from the formula it has used to deliver this universal support.

This is another one of those anomalies where things that are left open sometimes result in those who are intended and entitled to receive a credit not receiving it. I want to add to the examples that have been given and detail the additional complexity that arises where there is a multi-unit facility with one MPRN and individual pay-as-you-go meters. There are a number of these around this city and there is the additional and combined problem of individual landlords possibly not passing on the credit, as well as the lack of protection against disconnections. The people affected are particularly exposed and are getting less support than many others. This amendment would go some way towards addressing that disadvantage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2022-10-13 09:00:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	I raise the issue of Garda resources in County Meath. We have the lowest number of gardaí per head of population, at one per 668 people. We have a joint policing committee meeting tonight in Ratoath, which is the largest town in Ireland without a Garda station. This is testament to a lack of investment. There has been an increase in crime and in the number of unsolved crimes. There was a target to recruit 800 gardaí this year, but only 24 have been recruited. Since 2016, there has been an increase of just two gardaí per every 100,000 people. There is a chronic shortage of resources in the county. What is the Government going to do to address that?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 14:00:00+01:00	Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]	1	"I move: That Dáil Éireann: notes: — that the latest round of energy price hikes announced by energy providers is putting severe financial pressure on people; — that households are facing extraordinary costs to light and heat their homes this winter, and will need equivalent support from the Government and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) during this time; — that, in the first half of 2022, there were 712 domestic electricity and 309 domestic gas disconnections due to non-payment of account; — that there are 260,000 residential electricity pre-pay customers and 118,000 residential pre-pay gas customers; — the lack of research and monitoring into so called ""self-disconnections"", and into the number of people who are disconnected from pre-pay meters; — that Sinn Féin's Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 sought to extend the moratorium on disconnections to run over the entire Fuel Allowance season, to give financially struggling households assurance that they will not be left in the cold and dark during the winter months; — that the Government delayed the second reading of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Prohibition of Winter Disconnections) Bill 2021 by 12 months; and — the CRU confirmation, at the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action, that they lack the legislative remit to regulate standing charges on utility bills; acknowledges  — that households need financial and regulatory support during this energy price crisis, not the threat of disconnections hanging over them; condemns  — the Government's failure to put in place a protection from disconnections for those who use pre-pay meters; and calls for: — a moratorium on disconnections to be immediately put in place for all households until the end of the Fuel Allowance season; — the friendly credit on pre-pay meters to be extended for the duration of the ban on disconnections to give pre-pay meter households the same protection from disconnections as other households; — legislation to be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills; — the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates; and — a windfall solidarity tax to be introduced on the excess profits of energy companies. This motion seeks to do a number of important things. It seeks to extend the moratorium on electricity and gas disconnections to all customers from now until the end of the fuel allowance season, which is late March or early April. A ban on disconnections is currently in place but it is far too limited. It applies to self-identified and registered medically vulnerable bill-pay customers. In other words, it applies to a subset, self-identified, of a subset, registered, of a subset, medically vulnerable, of a subset, bill-pay. It was introduced on 1 October and runs until the end of the March. It is far too limited in its scope. For other bill-pay customers the ban on disconnection kicks in from 1 December and runs to the end of February. That is an extremely limited three-month ban at a time when 581,000 people are living below the poverty line according to European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, Ireland. This is also a time when up to 43% of people - which is a record, but a conservative estimate - are at risk of or living in energy poverty, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. It is also a time when the Government’s budget is failing to keep pace with the cost of living, according to the Vincentian research centre. It is also a time when energy suppliers are disconnecting approximately 170 domestic gas and electricity customers every month.  In the case of pay-as-you-go customers, there is no ban on disconnections despite the Taoiseach’s public comments, which gave rise to headlines such as ""Taoiseach confirms pay-as-you-go utility customers will not be disconnected if unable to top up"", ""Taoiseach: no disconnections of pay-as-you-go energy users this winter"" and ""Pay-as-you-go energy customers will not be disconnected this winter – Taoiseach"". In the days and weeks that followed those statements, it became quite clear that the Taoiseach had no intention of delivering on that commitment. Instead, people were told that there would be a €10 extra emergency credit. It has now increased to €20. Is that enough? People were told to contact the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In other words, they were told to make contact with charities. That is not the answer. People were told to go to the community welfare officer. This shows just how out of touch this Government and its Ministers are. In the first nine months of this year, the number of exceptional needs claims increased by 66,000, or 37%. Claims are processed in weeks or months, not hours or even days. That is most certainly not the answer.  We were told that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was meeting with all the energy suppliers and with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. There was some indication that we would have movement. Instead the Minister came away from those meetings and with a straight face went on national radio to tell us that pay-as-you-go is actually good for people.  Nothing was said about the rip-off tariffs that they are on, the rip-off standing charges being applied or the number of medically vulnerable people who are on pay-as-you-go meters and should be on bill pay and most certainly nothing was said about the need to extend the exact same protections and supports to pay-as-you-go customers as we have for bill-pay customers. As we set out in our motion, it can and should be done through the extension of the so-called friendly credit and it should happen immediately. The risk of disconnection from gas and electricity should be lifted from families. It is a matter of the values that we, as a country, hold in this Republic.  Our motion also calls for legislation to be introduced to give the CRU powers to regulate standing charges on energy bills. We further call on the Government to reduce and cap the price of electricity bills at summer 2021 rates and to introduce a windfall and solidarity tax on the excess profits of energy companies.  This is a time of extreme crises – an energy crisis and a cost-of-living crisis. The State needs to stretch itself. This Government took the recommendations at face value from the CRU and did nothing with them. They should have been stress tested and challenged. That organisation does not hold up well in the current climate. They should have been challenged and extended. Sinn Féin has a suite of proposals that the Minister needs to take and implement."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 14:00:00+01:00	Domestic Electricity and Gas Disconnections: Motion [Private Members]	2	The Minister of State and the Minister filled their time and talked about everything but the issue at hand. This was particularly so with the clear call for the extension of the disconnection ban to all customers from now until the end of March. There was no commitment from Government to do that. There was no commitment to provide a solution for pay-as-you-go customers. The solution there would be to ensure they have the exact same protections as billpay customers have. The Government did not provide a solution for them. I think I am right in saying, and it would be important to clarify this, that the facility to transfer onto a billpay contract is limited only to vulnerable customers. As I said before, that is a subset of a subset of a subset of a subset. That provision should be made available to all customers.  Not opposing this motion while not supporting it either amounts to a shameful abandonment of those people, who are in deep need of support from this Government. It is not a big ask to extend the fundamental principle that in the middle of a crisis, we in this Republic will not disconnect people from heat and light this winter. It should not be a challenge. However, this is a reflection of a failure of Government to support people in need.  The argument was made that pay-as-you-go is good for some people as it helps them manage their bills. It is offensive. It completely misses the point. We know people are, for want of a better term, self-disconnecting. We know people are facing real financial hardship but they are not being supported. This Government is pretending they do not exist. That is in effect what it is doing and it is the sum total of the Minister and Minister of State's contributions to this debate. At the root of all this is an argument of moral hazard, namely, that there is a cohort of people we cannot extend the same protection to because they could not manage their affairs. That is insulting, offensive and is implied by the fact the Government will not extend the same protections to that cohort of people as it has to everybody else. I wanted to put that on record. People can see through it.  There is an opportunity to address it, which we have spelled out. The Government should extend the friendly credit. It should show those people it will support them over this winter. The Government does not even count the people who are so-called self-disconnecting. They are being completely disregarded and explained away on the basis it is good for them to manage their own accounts. They need to be supported. They deserve the exact same protections as the rest of us.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-25 14:00:00+01:00	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	1	I move: That Dáil Éireann: notes:  — that the transport sector accounts for 17.7 per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions, and investment in public transport can play a central role in helping to reduce carbon emissions; — that expanding affordable, accessible and reliable public transport infrastructure across the island can deliver environmental, social and economic benefits to all cities, towns and regions; — that 13.5 per cent of the population have a disability, and ensuring universal access for all on public transport must be a priority; — that a lack of public transport options in rural Ireland means many workers and families are completely reliant on private car use for education, work and leisure, and should not be penalised financially for this; — that commercial bus operators deliver important connectivity in areas the State failed to invest in, and accounted for 30 million passenger journeys in 2019; and — the concerning level of anti-social behaviour across public transport services; recognises: — the detrimental impact on commuters who rely on bus services in Dublin and the Greater Dublin Area as a result of the previous Fine Gael Government's decision to privatise 10 per cent of bus routes in these areas;  — the failure of the Government to extend the 20 per cent public transport fare reduction to commercial bus operators in Budget 2023; and — that the Western Rail Corridor is not included in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, nor will the Navan railway line be completed within the lifetime of the revised plan; acknowledges: — that the Navan railway line and the Western Rail Corridor combined could provide for an additional 2,375,000 sustainable passenger journeys each year and deliver significant economic and social benefits to these regions; — the call from the National Bus and Rail Union for the establishment of a dedicated transport policing unit; — that many people with a disability continue to face barriers using public transport, such as broken lifts, limited wheelchair spaces or having to give 24-hour notice before their journey in order to have a ramp in place; — the very poor standard of service being delivered by Go-Ahead Ireland in particular, which includes late buses, overcrowding and no-shows; and — the failure of the Government to include specific funding in Budget 2023 to extend the Short Hop Zones to more train stations to reduce the cost of travel for commuters; and calls for: — the 20 per cent public transport fare reduction to be extended to commercial bus operators; — the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan to be accelerated; — funding to be allocated to kickstart the delivery of the Western Rail Corridor project and expedite the delivery of the Navan railway line; — the establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit; — the Public Transport Accessibility Retrofit Programme budget to be increased, to ensure accessibility at all train stations, platforms and bus stops; — the National Transport Authority (NTA) to exercise their regulatory powers to ensure punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are met by all public transport providers; — the Minister for Transport to mandate the NTA to ensure that the current contractual agreement between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland will not be extended beyond its current contractual timeframe, and that the 10 per cent of previously privatised services would be brought back under public or State-owned control; and — the extension of the Short Hop Zones, in order to reduce the cost of travel for commuters currently excluded. Expanding our public transport network across the State can deliver environmental, social and economic benefits to all regions. Unfortunately, due to decades of neglect by successive Governments, large swaths remain without quality public transport links, while some regions remain entirely cut off from our rail network. People in rural Ireland are punished by a punitive carbon tax for having to use their car, despite the Government putting no alternatives in place for them. The rail network we have today is a skeleton of what we had 100 years ago. This has resulted in communities being isolated and has contributed to the stagnation of economic growth in some regions. Sinn Féin wants to change this. We want to see an accessible, affordable, reliable all-Ireland transport system that enables the movement of people and goods locally, regionally and nationally at the least environmental, social and financial cost. That is at the heart of our motion tonight. This plan could and should be implemented.  The motion contains a number of measures that I have raised with the Minister before and all of which are contained in our alternative budget, which we believe should be acted on. We want to see the 20% public transport fare reduction made permanent, not just extended until the end of next year, and extended to commercial bus operators. The latter were responsible for in the region of 30.5 million trips in 2019. They fill a gap that the State has left open. They provide a very important service.  We want to see the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural bus plan accelerated. I have raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions. I am referring to the €5 million allocated in 2022 and to a €56 million plan that would deliver significantly for communities if invested in and rolled out on time. Sinn Féin would invest €25 million in that plan next year.  We want to see funding allocated to kick-start the delivery of the western rail corridor project and expedite the delivery of the Navan rail line. Between these two important regional projects, in the region of 2.375 million passenger journeys could be made every year, taking people out of their cars and putting them on public transport.  We want to see a dedicated public transport and policing unit established. We have had much discussion on this topic. It has included backbenchers and various Ministers and Ministers of State but we have had no progress on it. We are aware that anti-social behaviour and crime on public transport are increasing, putting workers, including drivers, and passengers at risk. We know the unit would be a deterrent. According to research carried out by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, just 15% of women in Dublin felt safe on a train and just 24%, or almost one in four, felt safe on the bus network. This should be a genuine concern. It needs to be addressed. The establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit, as called for by several unions, should be part of the solution.  We want to see the public transport accessibility retrofit programme budget increased year on year to bring it, in five years, to the €137.5 million that is said to be needed to deliver a fully accessible public transport network with buses, coaches, light and heavy rail, and, importantly, stops, stations and platforms. That needs to be done.  We want the short-hop zones extended to reduce the cost of travel for commuters who are currently excluded. My colleague, Deputy Munster, has been particularly vocal about the anomaly that exists between Balbriggan, Gormanston, Laytown and Drogheda. This is but one of several examples in Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow. These need to be addressed. Sinn Féin would do so.  My last point, on which some of my colleagues will pick up, is that we need to see the Fine Gael agenda to privatise 10% of Dublin Bus routes to be scrapped and reversed. The Go-Ahead experiment has failed miserably; it needs to be reversed.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-25 14:00:00+01:00	Public Transport: Motion [Private Members]	2	"I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, stated that some elements of the motion ""do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently under way or the Government's future plans for public transport."" I do not know what that means. We have set out, for example, in the area of Connecting Ireland, the rural bus plan which is supported by the Opposition, that the Government is not investing enough in it and not rolling it out at a suitable pace. The Minister of State also said implementation of the programme would continue at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available. The reason we tabled the motion is that we are not satisfied adequate progress has been made on Connecting Ireland. We have spelled out what we believe the Government should do, which is to increase the investment in it.  I can give examples from my county. Some months ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, informed the House that Kentstown would have a service this year, after 40 years without one. It will not have it this year because the commitment is not being delivered on. The same applies elsewhere. Invest in the Navan rail line now, not post 2031 as the Government reaffirmed tonight. The same goes for the dedicated public transport policing unit. It has to happen in order for workers and passengers to feel safe to use public transport. Services must be expanded, costs and fares driven down and the people working on and using our public transport system protected.  We also need accountability. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, made the point, which the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, echoed that the NTA engages in contracts with providers and it is a matter for them. The Minister for Transport is responsible for the delivery of the public transport network. I have sat in Opposition for at least four hours of debate on public transport in the last couple of weeks and the Minister has not been here for one minute of it. I and others have discussed with the Minister of State and others Go-Ahead Ireland and the lack of accountability for its service, and the senior Minister has not been here for any of that discussion. We want to see accountability for the provision of public transport services. There is significant room for improvement there.  We are lucky with the huge effort and work that workers in the public transport service provide and deliver. They need to be supported and resourced. There are a huge number of issues to be tackled in terms of licensing, rostering, pay and terms and conditions that should reward those people and encourage more to go into that sector to deliver the scale and number of services the people of Ireland need and deserve."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-26 09:10:00+01:00	Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022: Second Stage	1	"It is ironic. Such is the curtailed nature of this whole debate, the Minister of State cannot deliver the most basic of remarks reflecting the contents of the Bill within the guillotined time he has. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows how we feel on this side of the House on so many occasions when it comes to legislation and emergency legislation from the Minister.  This is yet more emergency legislation that is being rushed through by the Government due to the unmitigated failure to manage our electricity demand and supply. It is quite remarkable that we are now being asked to completely set aside important planning and environmental conditions for the installation of 450 MW of power generators. In effect, it is more than a topical issue; I would say that it is a national scandal.  At the outset, I must state my discomfort about bypassing the planning and environmental impact assessment process, as that brings with it obvious risks. In truth, it is an invidious position for the Opposition. This Government has walked the State to the cliff edge when it comes to energy security, electricity supply, and the risk of blackouts. As a result, we urgently need backup generators put in place to try to help keep the lights on in the coming winters. This is acknowledged and we will be responsible in our opposition.  As I have said before with regard to previous legislation and it also applies to this proposed legislation, this is no way to do scrutiny and is no way to do legislation. The Bill received no pre-legislative scrutiny and is being rushed through all Stages in one day. It is curtailed in a way that is far more extreme than we are used to, such is the nature of it. It is a dreadful approach. It is the wrong approach. I would imagine that it is, at least in part, related to the absolute chaos and frantic goings on within the Department and within the Ministry.  The Bill seeks to set aside normal planning and environmental requirements to allow emergency electricity generators to be installed quickly at two existing power plants, Shannonbridge and Tarbert, or at some as yet unidentified place, for operation in the coming winters. Despite the fact that Ukraine is referenced in the Title, we do not need these generators because we have just run out of gas due to that dreadful war. We do not need them because the shipments of oil have stopped. We need these extra generators because of the spectacular mismanagement of our electricity supply and demand over the past number of years. Successive Governments, the CRU, and EirGrid all share some responsibility for this failure. We simply do not have enough generation capacity to meet the growing electricity demand. This is despite repeated warnings over a number of years about the growing shortfall. Again, this is unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine. The Government should take responsibility for its failures in this area and not try and hide behind other external factors.  Last June, when we were dealing with another emergency item of legislation, the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told us he had appointed the former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy, to undertake a review of how we ended up in this crisis. That is appropriate. Will the Minister provide an update on the status of this review? When will the review be completed and will he publish it in full? Will there be accountability up to and including ministerial level and the agencies?  We do not need to wait for the McCarthy review to tell us some of the contributory factors. EirGrid has said that since 2016, its generation capacity statements have warned of an increasing tightness between demand and supply. In addition, EirGrid issued 18 amber alerts since 2017, with 17 of these since this Government took office in 2020. These were all flashing red lights that went unheeded.  All the while, it was full steam ahead for the rampant increase on the demand side and especially in the expansion of data centres. The policy was to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world. We all recognise the role data centres play in a digitised society but it was reckless in the extreme to pursue this approach so vigorously when our offshore wind generation was non-existent, when power plants were ageing and being wound down and when there were clear warnings about the increasing tightness between demand and supply. In truth, the State and the Government could have brought forward this legislation 12 months ago, but it did not. It was conscious Government choices that contributed to the current situation.  Another contributory factor to this current situation was the Government’s failure to develop our offshore wind over the past decade. Along with others, I was in Scotland recently, visiting the Moray East offshore wind farm and I witnessed at first hand how far ahead of us they are, specifically due to choices they made in recent years. The Fine Gael Administrations that we have had here over the past decade wasted a huge opportunity to exploit our massive offshore wind potential over this time. It was a lack of vision, whether it was for offshore, onshore or solar. It was a lack of vision and a lack of foresight. To put it simply, they failed the people of Ireland. As a result, we are still hugely reliant on imported energy and are now required, in a climate emergency, to continue to build more fossil fuel infrastructure to help meet our basic electricity demands. If we had developed just a fraction of our offshore wind potential by now or if we had expanded our onshore or solar generation, we would not need to procure this new capacity at this scale and in this way with expensive diesel generators. Instead, we could have relied on existing infrastructure or less demand.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, outline for how long these generators will be in place? We are aware that these generators will be in place until 2027 but perhaps a Minister of State will outline the process for decommissioning them or for moving them on. This issue was raised at a previous stage but during their operation, who exactly will own the generators when they are operating and afterwards? How will that structure work? This question had been raised, in fairness, from the Government and from the Opposition at various Stages of the passage of the recent EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill. This issue still needs to be addressed. Will the Minister of State outline how these facilities and generators will be procured, what will be the ownership structure for them, how will they be sold on and what will be the terms of that? There is a real concern that we will roll forward a number of years to 2027 and having spent €350 million, which is a huge amount of taxpayers' money, they would be sold off for a song or that some private entity will reap the huge rewards of that. What protections are there for the taxpayers' €350 million?  During the debate on the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill, a question arose about the charge that would be added to ordinary household electricity bills to help to cover the €350 million cost. The Minister did not have a specific figure at that time. Will the Minister of State confirm how much this procurement process will add to ordinary people's bills to cover the cost of the 450 MW? A figure of €40 was speculated on but is that figure confirmed? It is clear now that it is not €200 million and that it will be €350 million.  In the last minute I have to speak I will touch on some of the amendments that Sinn Féin has submitted. We will have even less time to discuss those later on. The first is a concern that is shared by many others and it came up at the very short briefing we had with the Department on this. It concerns the text ""or at alternative appropriate sites"". I believe that this is far too vague. I question whether it is consistent with the provisions of the directive. It certainly leaves it very loose.  We also have an important amendment, and I hope the Minister of State will support it, to require a report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas following a post-enactment review. This is unprecedented legislation. It gives huge powers and sidesteps significant protections for communities. It should not be done lightly. There should be a review and it should be laid before the Houses."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-26 09:10:00+01:00	Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages	1	I will be brief because the point has been mad with regard to this amendment. I want to make a point about some of the other amendments in the grouping. I support all of them, especially amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Bacik. It does what a number of other amendments seek to do, namely to increase transparency, accountability, scrutiny and the assessment of the particular projects that are to be delivered. I have tabled an amendment relating to a review and I notice that another amendment relates to assessing and identifying the climate impact of these projects. These are entirely sensible, reasonable and practical proposals from the Opposition and I really believe the Minister should take them on board and act on them. I am sure that in 30 minutes we will not get to all of them but I think the Minister should support them.

My amendment is on the same theme. As I mentioned, there is a need to measure emissions. This Bill is emergency legislation introduced in exceptional circumstances. There are significant risks associated with it and the opportunity for increased scrutiny, accountability and review is an important one that should be taken.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2022-10-27 09:00:00+01:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	The next time the Dáil sits, COP27 will be under way. The conference will hear that greenhouse gas emissions were at record levels last year. Ireland has ambitious targets that are agreed. They include a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. To achieve that, offshore wind will play a significant role. Our ports will also play a significant role but they will need to be ready. We know they sought funding through the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, but they were not successful. We do not have a port that is ready for the manufacture and installation of offshore wind infrastructure. They will need significant funding, be it through the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or green funds. Is this a priority for the Tánaiste and his Department? Will there be a commitment to funding next year and in the years ahead to realise the opportunity of offshore wind and to drive down our emissions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-27 09:00:00+01:00	Energy Security: Statements	1	The war in Ukraine has exposed how vulnerable this State is to volatility in the international energy markets and reinforced the need to radically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and become energy-independent. Ireland imports a little over 70% of the energy we use and this is well over the EU average of 58%. Oil accounts for 45% of primary energy needs and gas for a further 34%. All of the oil used in Ireland is imported, as is three quarters of our gas. This highlights our massive reliance on others to keep the lights on and the economy moving. Despite having an almost unlimited amount of renewable energy available off our coast and on our rooftops, the failure to develop this over the past 20 years has significantly contributed to our energy insecurity.  Offshore wind can deliver energy independence and security for our island. Done right, we can create jobs here, bring down the cost of electricity, radically reduce emissions from the energy sector and deliver lasting energy security. The potential to become a net exporter of electricity and green hydrogen to Europe also offers us a huge opportunity to raise significant revenue for reinvestment in climate action. I had the opportunity recently to travel to the Moray East offshore wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen alongside colleagues from the climate action committee. This wind farm alone will produce enough electricity to power 1 million homes. It is a remarkable feat of engineering and highlights the opportunity we have on this island to do the same.  However, we have had a lost decade of development in Ireland. Fine Gael took office back in 2011 and wasted a massive opportunity to spearhead the development of offshore wind over the subsequent ten years. While Scotland was literally laying the foundations, successive Governments here did nothing. There were no offshore auctions, no resourcing of our planning agencies, no port investment, no maritime area planning, no supply chain development, no apprenticeships; the list goes on. While I welcome the step change since the Minister took over, I am concerned the energy transition is not receiving the primacy of focus it requires. Issues around planning and ports, in particular, are still not being addressed. They are immediate pinch points for the sector and for the opportunities that present. Having raised the matter with the Tánaiste during Questions on Policy or Legislation this morning, I am not convinced the Government is taking it seriously enough or that it is receiving the requisite attention.  The industry has set out in stark terms what needs to be done to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind farms. It has warned that we will miss our 2030 targets if that delivery is not achieved. Unfortunately, I do not see a similar level of concern from the Minister. We need to see our planning agencies resourced properly to reduce the planning delays faced by offshore wind projects. We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects but we also need decisions to be made in a timely manner. The renewables industry has pointed out that the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks, and 69 weeks for strategic infrastructure developments, versus the statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks. This is evidence of a broken system that must be addressed if we are to deliver the scale of offshore wind required.  Last October, approval was given by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to An Bord Pleanála for an additional eight personnel for the planning authority's marine and climate unit. Despite this, by July of this year, just three of those posts had been filled. Others were not even advertised. This simply is not good enough.  Last month, we heard that just one port in Ireland, namely, Belfast, is capable of hosting the construction and installation of offshore wind farms. If we do not invest in and ready our ports now, we will lose the jobs and supply chain business from these multibilllion euro projects to ports in Britain. We will miss our renewables targets and our emissions reduction objectives. I note that the four Irish ports that applied for EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility were unsuccessful. This is concerning. The Government must step in to kick-start the investment that is required. We need particular and focused investment in Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Cork Dockyard. In addition, we need to invest in our electricity grid, develop our battery storage and green hydrogen sectors and reduce the cost of producing renewable energy here. These are the solutions to the problem in the longer term. I urge the Minister of State to prioritise addressing them.  Sinn Féin has been campaigning for years for our solar potential to be fully utilised. The International Energy Agency, IEA, has highlighted that in a period of just 90 minutes, enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's energy needs for a whole year. While solar energy is abundant, it represents a tiny fraction of Ireland's current energy mix. Sinn Féin published its Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill almost six years ago but little progress has been made since then to roll out solar energy in homes. We want to see solar photovoltaic, PV, panels installed on homes, businesses, schools, sports facilities, community buildings and farms across Ireland to help to cut our carbon emissions and deliver savings for citizens and communities. Installing an average-sized solar PV system on a home can generate 40% of the electricity needs of that household. This is particularly important given the massive electricity costs households now face. The MaREI Centre in Cork has found that solar panels could power a quarter of Irish households. I welcome the Government's solar for schools initiative and would like to see the detail on it.  Last month, Sinn Féin welcomed the long overdue publication of the energy security review. The report short-listed gas storage options of strategic floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, and strategic storage onshore or offshore. These options must be considered in the context of fossil fuel lock-in and ease of conversion to hydrogen or other low- or zero-carbon fuels. Commercial LNG is not short-listed, but is long-listed, due to the fact such a facility could result in the importation of fracked gas and could, furthermore, become a stranded asset. In regard to the notion of a stranded asset, I echo the call made repeatedly by my colleague, Senator Boylan, that Ireland needs to follow the example of the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Poland and probably France in leaving the Energy Charter Treaty. It is a bad deal that potentially will leave a significant burden on Irish taxpayers if we are left with these types of stranded assets. We have been expressing our concerns for some time about Ireland's lack of gas storage. Currently, 93.8% of the EU's gas storage is filled but Ireland does not have any such facility.  In the time remaining, it would be remiss of me not to refer to one of the other significant challenges facing Ireland We need a conversation on data centres. There has been a policy failure in this regard, including a failure in planning. We need a real discussion on how many data centres we can manage and what our fair share might be. Again, we have seen a developer-led approach rather than a plan-led approach. We must look at where these centres are located, whether they are providing district heating and how they are powered. They are putting huge pressure on the electricity grid and may potentially put huge pressure on the gas grid. They could be powered entirely by renewables if they were prescribed to do so. It could be a different story but it is not.  We need a clear focus on the McCarthy review into what has led us to this point. It is a failure of the Government to bring us to the brink of blackouts for a number of winters. That needs to be investigated. We have had representatives of the CRU before the Oireachtas climate committee, where they pointed to the failure of the T-4 auction. That needs to be investigated and the committee is going to do some work in this regard. There must be accountability. There are question marks over the Minister of the day, the Department, the CRU, EirGrid and others in the energy landscape in Ireland. We need accountability and lessons must be learned. The big opportunity is in renewables. There will be a transition to be managed and it must be done carefully and right.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-15 14:00:00+00:00	Science Week: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on statements on Science Week. I welcome the fact we are having this debate and that we have Science Week. It is a good opportunity for the House to address these issues that do not always get the focus they deserve. Of course, they are hugely important to our country and its future.  The theme this year was to explore the infinite possibilities of science to address social challenges and to help to understand our world. There are a couple of important points. This is about the idea of infinite possibilities and how you build a system that provides the necessary focus for the realisation of some of them. There are also issues around social challenges and understanding our world.  I welcome that the Minister placed an emphasis on climate in his contribution, which is what I will do in mine. We must think about the climate challenge as one that requires a scientific and technical response. When we speak about the sector, we have got into that habit of talking about sectoral ceilings and dealing with this issue on a sectoral basis, However, if we look at energy, transport, retrofitting or agriculture, for example, huge scientific advances in recent years have provided us with opportunities. I firmly believe we need to position ourselves as a country to lead in this field, whether it be in terms of energy or elsewhere.  Onshore wind technology has hugely advanced. Offshore technology is emerging but will advance in the time ahead. It is the same with solar energy. Our understanding has increased in the area of hydrogen in recent months and years. The opportunity there will depend on the efforts of the sector and the many scientists and technicians in the area, and likewise in the area of biofuels. In transport, new emerging battery technologies are increasing efficiency and effectiveness. We have sustainable aviation fuels. We are dealing with new building materials, progressing with retrofitting and installing new heating systems. In respect of agriculture, Teagasc appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action this morning to look at the whole range of research it is conducting in the area of land use. There is, therefore, almost exponential potential for our country. Within that, we must prioritise and maintain focus. It is important that we put the requisite resources and supports in place to encourage this. In science, we must build the environment to encourage the endeavour of individual scientists and as a collective. There must be incentives. We await the hydrogen strategy, for example. I welcome the fact that that ball is now rolling more quickly than it was heretofore.  Deputy Ó Laoghaire touched on the issue of basic versus applied science. As a country, we need to take risks in the area of scientific endeavour in terms of research and innovation. There is very often the constraint that the research that gets funded is that which will be commercial and deliver a return. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, we do not know what the technology is that will deliver for us and for climate; it may not exist yet. There is certainly an element within our response to climate change that is a moonshot. Our efforts are a statement of intent about doing the right things at this time to hopefully deliver the requisite responses in the years ahead. Some of that will be commercial; some of it will not.  I will make the point that we must take those risks. Sometimes, in some of these spaces, I quite often get the sense at either an institutional, governmental or departmental level that we are waiting to see what is happening in other countries. We cannot lead on everything but we need to be strategic and look at our strengths as a country, whether that is in terms of offshore energy, hydrogen, renewable technologies or whatever it may be and we need to be brave. We must support those who are working in those areas. It is really important that our research is open access and available, and that we support our scientists. Deputy Ó Laoghaire mentioned supports for student scientists and PhD students. I made the case previously for working scientists in the medical sciences and elsewhere. We must provide them with a wage, stipend or support to be able to live in the communities in which they work and study. There is significant opportunity for the institutions and states that are brave and ambitious at this time. The Minister mentioned climate, food and health. We have made significant progress in technology and IT, health sciences and life sciences. The green economy holds great potential. Some of the endeavour will be Betamax, some of it will be VHS, some of it will be neither. It is important that we enter into all of this with a spirit of support for the scientific effort. We should respect and support basic and social sciences as much as applied sciences. We should respect and support those who are supported by major pharmaceutical companies as much as we do pioneering local research in individual hospitals or third-level institutions. It is important to get the balance right.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-16 09:10:00+00:00	Energy Regulations: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to address this matter. The issue of electricity and energy affordability is central at this time. The motion points to the need to reform a broken market. That needs to happen, but we also need to address the cost of electricity and maximise State and community ownership of our national resources. That is not stated in the motion, but it should be.  The market is broken, and the Government has stood steadfast against reforms for far too long. Colleagues of mine here and at European level have advocated for market reform for many years. That became a very apparent necessity as far back as summer 2021. The Government, in October 2021, voted against proposals for reform. In June, the Minister of State said to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, that he did not think it was a good idea to reform the market or decouple the price of gas from that of electricity. On 11 August, the Minister for Finance said of decoupling the price of gas from that of electricity that such a windfall tax would undermine our energy independence. Essentially, it would undermine the profits of energy companies and impact on the amount they would have to reinvest. Countries that took a different approach, such as Spain and Portugal, were able to realise significant savings for electricity customers. The Government has been a barrier to that.  I welcome the U-turn, but it was a matter of a nod to the European Union and to the markets and of failing to be brave or act in the interests of the Irish people. That has happened time and again. It is the same in the context of the solidarity windfall tax and tackling the massive profits of Corrib Gas, for example. That is a Canadian company, and we talk about the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement. There are the massive profits of BP and Shell, €9 billion and €8 billion, respectively. The price of wind has not increased. The price of taking gas or oil out of the ground has not increased either, but the massive profits of these greedy companies have increased massively. They need to be tackled fast. My party has advocated for that for a long time.  The same goes at home in respect of the standing charge. The latter has been increased time and again, including by State-owned companies such as Electric Ireland and the ESB, without reason or explanation. The CRU tells us it does not have the legislative capacity to deal with that matter. This needs to be addressed.  Sinn Féin put forward a suite of proposals in a policy document, Vision for Renewable Energy, it launched this week. The answer for Ireland is energy independence in the form of renewables owned, as much as possible, by the State and local communities, generating jobs in the regions and stimulating local and export economies, in terms of every type of renewable and hydrogen. I will touch on a number of our proposals. We need to reform the public service obligation. That is the mechanism for funding renewables. It is a regressive levy in that it is flat and benefits large energy users because it is levied at peak demand rather than at average demand. We need to increase State investment in the forms of taxation and to incentivise and ensure communities can compete against corporations. We need a task force on the cost of renewables. Those costs are significantly lower than gas, as has been mentioned, but in Ireland those costs are greater than in other countries. That needs to be addressed. The Government has not done enough to protect people and needs to do it.

The Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, said we are at crisis point and pointed to acute shortages in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kildare. I speak on behalf of my own constituency in Meath where I know the situation is exactly the same. Many issues are raised such as the cost of rents and pay inequality. I know there have been some responses with regard to student teachers and there are the sub-seeker and teaching transforms programmes. Is there a focus on this and a plan to address the acute shortage?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-23 09:10:00+00:00	Transport in Galway and Other Areas: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the motion and I thank the Independent Group. It chimes very well with the demands regarding the environment and climate and the needs of communities to deliver sustainable transport with a particular focus on public and active travel. There is growing recognition that we need system change rather than to push on individual behaviours. We need a scale of change that we have not seen previously. This requires the institutions of the State and its agencies to get their houses in order and have the focus and energy and strategy to deliver on systemic change.  I support the proposition that Galway act as a pilot. There is much in the motion pointing towards very sensible proposals on park and ride, rail and other mobility methods. The point made by Deputy Harkin is fair. There are principles that can be applied not only in Galway but throughout the State. In our alternative proposal Sinn Féin recognises there are significant opportunities for the State to lead and apply the principle of build-it-and-they-will-come and the principle that when public transport alternatives are there for people and they are accessible, affordable and reliable, people will use them. We do not have to imagine this as a scenario. We see it here and we certainly see it internationally.  We have called on the Government to take a number of measures to realise this. In our alternative budget we called for the reduction of 20% on fares to be made permanent and to extend that to commercial bus operators. We called for a public transport fare reduction of 50% for those aged under 18 and that fares would be made free for those aged under 18 over two years. We called for the expanded roll-out of Connecting Ireland. It is a good plan from the NTA that would see improved bus services for populations of more than 300. The funding commitment is not yet there from the Government. We know the targets for the first year, which is 2022, are being missed.  We have called for an extension of the short hop zones. These are particularly relevant in the commuter belt area around Dublin. We have called for investment in the western rail corridor and the Navan rail project, extending beyond what the Government is doing in the national development plan. These two critical pieces of rail infrastructure would deliver 2.375 million sustainable journeys on an annual basis. We have called for increased investment in accessibility for people with disabilities and increased investment in the public transport accessibility retrofit programme. There is a plan and there are particular challenges with our coach network. This needs to be advanced at a pace. We have called for a dedicated public transport policing unit to ensure people can feel safe on public transport, whether they be passengers or workers. We have called for increased investment in our school bus transport scheme services and fleet. This is to ensure school bus transport would be widely available, we would not refuse thousands of children every year and the buses would be up to standard.  I want to touch on how the principles and motion might apply to my county of Meath. We need investment in the Navan rail project. I know from the response to a parliamentary question that I received this morning from the NTA that the greater Dublin area transport strategy is with the Minister. He needs to sign off so the ball can get rolling on the Navan rail project. Funding needs to be allocated to the project. If Sinn Féin were in government, the project would start now and not after 2031 as the Government intends. We need an improvement in services in County Meath. In the past 24 hours, scores of people were waiting at bus stops for the 105X, 103 and NX. This is not acceptable and it needs to be addressed.  Connecting Ireland needs to be rolled out and expanded. Of course the hot topic of the day is incentives for people when the alternatives are not there. We have tolls in Meath, where there is a double toll on the M3. Drivers have to pay two tolls to get from Kells to Dublin. There is also a toll on the M1, which has an impact on the behaviour of drivers on that road. We have congestion every morning, which people will be familiar with if they listen to traffic reports. Kilmoon Cross is famous for traffic jams in part because traffic diverts off the M1 to avoid the toll. I call on the Minister of State to ensure the toll increases do not take effect at the start of January.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-29 14:00:00+00:00	COP27: Statements	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic. I also welcome these statements. I acknowledge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications for his work as EU ministerial representative at the loss and damage talks in Egypt. I thank the Irish officials whose work goes unseen but which was crucial to establishing a loss and damage fund.  Responding to the announcement of the fund, the climate change Minister of Pakistan, Ms Sherry Rehman, highlighted that the fund is not about some countries accepting charity but that it is down payment on an investment in our futures and climate justice. Her point about climate justice is really important.  Wealthier countries that account for just 12% of the global population are responsible for 50% of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years. Wealthier countries have contributed most to global warming. Many have built their economies and current national wealth on the back of considerable emissions. It is important that this be recognised and that funding be directed towards those countries that are now feeling the devastating consequences of global warming caused by these same emissions.  While the loss and damage fund was really positive, other aspects of COP27 were a significant disappointment. These included attempts to roll back on commitments made only one year ago at Glasgow and the inability to agree on strong language on the phasing out of fossil fuels - all fossil fuels. Advocacy group Global Witness highlighted that over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were in attendance at the climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh. That is even more than the number who attended in Glasgow last year. Their agenda is clear: to delay the transition from fossil fuels and greenwash ineffective actions in order to protect their profit and keep a business-as-usual approach for as long as they can. Fossil fuel lobbyists have no place at the UN conference. We would not invite big tobacco lobbyists to a lung cancer conference, so we should apply the same standard here. The interests of fossil fuel lobbyists do not align with efforts to cut our emissions radically. The lobbyists got a sympathetic ear in Egypt. Their exclusion in the future would be one step towards reforming the COP ahead of the next meeting, which is to take place in one of the biggest oil-producing countries in the world. It is vital that the public have confidence in the process and that it not be seen as a talking shop or circus. On the international stage, at European level, Ireland should be advocating the reform of the COP to ensure it is sufficient and effective and that it works.  If Ireland is to play its part in combating global warming, it needs a radical shift in the pace of delivery. We are almost midway through our first carbon budget but one would barely know that based on the action being taken. Instead of our emissions reducing by an average of 4.8% each year in the first cycle, they increased by 4.7% last year and will rise again this year. How are we supposed to meet the goal of a 51% cut by 2030 if we are this far off track now? Enormous cuts will be needed year on year at the end of this decade to make up for these lost years. In reality, the scale of those cuts, when required, will be such that they will be impossible to achieve in a single year.  I agree with the comments that Ms Marie Donnelly, the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, made at the sidelines of the COP to the effect that we need to tackle urgently some of the low-hanging fruit when cutting emissions here. In her comments, she specifically mentioned shallow retrofits, which we in Sinn Féin have been saying represent a considerable missed and available opportunity. Deep retrofitting is not happening at the scale required. The Minister's own figures show that. It is not credible to think that families across Ireland have a spare €30,000 to deep-retrofit their homes. I am not sure when the Government will realise that. Shallow retrofits and attic and cavity wall insulation are quick and affordable. In Sinn Féin's opinion, the State should be offering the full cost. Think of how many homes could be upgraded really quickly for a fraction of the price of a deep retrofit. It would deliver immediate carbon emissions reductions, help people save on their energy bills and improve health and well-being in the State's coldest homes.  The numbers for shallow retrofits have fallen off a cliff. In 2011, even at the height of the economic crisis, 51,577 attic insulations were carried out. In 2020 and 2021, similar to 2019, before Covid, the figure had dropped to below 5,000 annually, representing a full decade of missed opportunity. At that pace, it would take 100 years to complete the works on the 500,000 homes that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has said would benefit from attic and cavity wall insulation. Therefore, I asked the Minister to heed Ms Donnelly's comments and focus heavily on shallow retrofits in the time ahead.  Another issue that could be resolved quickly but that has not been to date is the under-resourcing of our planning system. The wind and solar industries have been banging this drum for some time. Some vital green-energy projects are caught in the system for far too long. Sinn Féin proposed in its alternative budget increased funding for our planning agencies and environmental NGOs to speed up planning applications. We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects and decisions to be made in a timely manner. The renewables industry said the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks. The average decision time for a strategic infrastructure development, SID, is 69 weeks, versus a statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks. We need more inspectors, ecologists and legal and administrative staff. Offshore projects to develop offshore windfarms need to put together environmental impact assessment reports as part of their applications, informed by fish and marine life surveys, marine mammal surveys and years of bird surveys. Environmental NGOs play an important role in this. Therefore increased funding for them would help them to contribute to complex planning applications to ensure we protect our biodiversity as we expand our energy production.  It is the same when it comes to our ports. Four Irish ports failed to secure EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility, but the State has not brought forward any alternatives. Belfast is the only port on the island currently capable of hosting the construction of offshore windfarms. If we do not invest and ready our ports now, we will lose jobs and supply chain business from multibillion euro projects to ports in Britain and elsewhere. Given the planning issues in ports, offshore wind experts I have spoken to are not confident that our 2030 target will be met and are mentioning 2035 more and more. I ask the Minister to assure the House that 2030 is still on target and there are plans to address the significant concerns around planning and port infrastructure. I mentioned foreshore licences, marine area consents and the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA. There are key timelines that need to be addressed.  Regarding transport emissions, Sinn Féin has proposed an increase of 10,000 places in the school transport scheme to harness the demand for the system and take thousands of cars off the roads every day. This has been inexplicably resisted to date. There is significant capacity to reduce our transport emissions if we provide the service. We have consistently argued with the National Transport Authority, NTA, about the need to reduce fares to encourage people to use public transport. It told us that was not the case and that we do not get the type of response indicated if fares are reduced. It said there is no clear correlation. We know now there is a clear correlation because we have empirical evidence, based on the impact of the 20% reduction in fares, which has seen significant increases in the uptake of public transport beyond what the NTA expected.  Separately, in terms of solar, farmers have asked about reforming the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant process to allow them to sell electricity to the grid and a change to the capital acquisition tax rules to encourage more solar on farms. Neither of those things has been considered. Farmers want to play their part but are not getting much co-operation in this area.  I refer to points made by the Minister at his party conference at the weekend when he discussed the increased ambition for solar energy, a doubling to 5 GW of the target included in the climate action plan and delivery five years ahead of what was originally scheduled. We keep having targets. It appears that, in the climate action plan there will be more targets, increased targets, shifting targets and a move away from electric vehicles, EVs, and offshore wind towards solar. We need delivery. We need the logistical or regulatory roadblocks and the planning and infrastructural barriers to be lifted. This needs to be a decade of delivery. That is what was demanded, not just at COP but at national level.

I note the Government's eleventh-hour intervention where it has decided to defer the road toll increases for six months. It is clear as day that the Government has been bounced into this decision as a direct result of political and, probably more importantly, public pressure. There has been a huge public response to this crazy proposal. The Department of Transport was notified of these toll increases three full months ago, on 1 September, yet it took until today to get any action from the Government, just hours before this Sinn Féin motion calling on the toll increases to be stopped. As early as this morning it was being reported that a decision would not be made until closer to the new year. It is a welcome action but it does not go far enough.   The Government's announcement does not solve the problem. It only serves to kick the can down the road and it fails to provide the certainty required by families. It does not address the underlying problems. There seems to be no recognition whatever that we are living in a crippling cost-of-living crisis. Workers, hauliers and businesses are really struggling with transport costs. It is now proposed that the tolls will increase instead next summer, at a time when petrol and diesel prices have gone back up due to the expiration of the excise relief and just before the Government hikes fuel prices yet again with its annual carbon tax increase. This proposed toll increase will add €8 million to the operating costs of hauliers in the second half of 2023. It will heap additional costs on workers and families who have no alternatives.   In recent days I have been contacted by hauliers who are put to the pin of their collars. They have real concerns that their businesses will go to the wall. I have been contacted by people who have to travel for dialysis six times a week on a disability payment. The increasing cost of petrol and diesel and the obligation to make the commute through the tolls is putting them under severe financial pressure. It is completely unacceptable that the Government would let this situation get to this point.   The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan buried his head in the sand on this and simply hoped it would go away. He can show interest in toll roads an has in the past when it suited him. In opposition he called for electric vehicle, EV, owners to pay no tolls at all but when it comes to ordinary motorists, commercial operators or people driving a white van or a lorry who cannot afford an EV or do not have an EV option, he has no interest at all. This entire saga highlights how generous these gold-plated Fianna Fáil-era road toll contracts are and further, how poorly successive Governments since have invested in roads maintenance and upkeep. The public private partnership, PPP, contracts seem to be a win, win, win for the private contractor. The M3 operator made €11 million profit last year. That company gets paid millions if not enough cars use the road. Its tolls go up with inflation and the State is locked into these contracts for decades. It is a cash cow.   Earlier, I read a 2010 article in
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-11-29 14:00:00+00:00	Toll Charge Increases: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]	1	"I thank all Members who contributed to the debate. It was important and timely and we saw some response from the Government on this issue. That response is late, however, and it does not go far enough. The Government knew as far back as early September that these proposed hikes were to come in in January. That is the time when a Minister for Transport who was in tune with the needs and lived experience of small business owners, of people driving vans trying to make ends meet, of commuters who get up early in the morning and get home late at night while working in the construction trades or wherever else, of haulage companies, for which he or she technically has responsibility and which would be faced with an €8 million bill if these proposed hikes came in, and of people who have to commute for dialysis, school, work or caring responsibilities in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when notified of these proposed increases, would have said ""No way"", that they could not proceed and that we had to find another way. That did not happen. The Minister has never, at any stage, said that. We have heard it from other Government party representatives and from other Government party leaders but we have never heard it from Deputy Ryan, the Minister with responsibility for the area. I welcome the fact that he is in the Chamber but we did not hear that from him even tonight.   In his deliberations, we heard that, whatever about the tolls, we knew where the money was not coming from. It was not coming from public transport or active travel and that, after that, it was somebody else's problem. It is the same tonight. In his contribution, the Minister pointed to measures the Government has taken. We support and have supported these measures and have prepared policy documents asking him to take different approaches and to go further with regard to public transport and active travel. We support such measures and our representatives will help deliver them in local communities. However, the Minister cannot ignore the fact that he has responsibility for the whole gamut of transport and that very many people have no alternative. They do not have the opportunity to switch to an electric vehicle, public transport or active travel. The Minister cannot ignore the plight of those people.   The fact that we have left it from 1 September until 29 November to act on this tells me that this is a Government and a Ministry that is not in tune with people's needs. As we speak, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII representatives are before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, scratching their heads and wondering whether they can get this done for 1 January because these are complex matters involving private contracts and a number of different parties. There is no guarantee and the mechanism will have to be negotiated. Without a shadow of a doubt, had TII been asked to do this on 1 September, it would have had a better chance of delivering it on 1 January. I encourage the Minister to take this motion and the debate tonight with him and to impress on the Department of Transport, on TII and on those profitable public private partnership, PPP, companies that they must ensure this measure is in place for 1 January.   However, as we have said, the Minister needs to go further than that. The period of six months is not long enough. During that time, I encourage the Minister to look at the funding mechanism for our national roads network. We have heard from TII that we invest approximately 2% of the value of our roads in their maintenance while 33% of this maintenance is dependent on tolls from the M50. That is the scheme we have built. It is based on PPP contracts and privatisation and represents a failure of Government to deliver on its responsibilities through general taxation. It is a failed model that is crucifying ordinary people and it needs to be addressed.   We also need a tolling scheme that incentivises the most efficient use of our roads. We have heavy goods vehicles and people in private cars avoiding the tolls by taking more minor roads, causing congestion. This is not an efficient use of our network and increases emissions, costs and congestion. It needs to be addressed and the Minister is responsible for doing that. I do not have confidence that he will but surely he has heard loud and clear from the commuting public that it needs to be done."

One of the central findings of the CervicalCheck scandal was showing up in lights the paternalistic nature of medicine and healthcare in Ireland. Ireland is not unique in that regard but we have a particular history, especially when it comes to women, poor people and people who are disadvantaged. In response to that, there are clear asks to address it. One of the things I took from the Scally report and this whole dreadful experience is there is a need for a culture shift. There is a need to address that information imbalance that exists between doctor and patient. It was at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal and how these women were failed.  The absence of the statutory duty of candour is a glaring omission that does not address the key issue at the heart of the scandal. The question of whether we can go further and do better must be asked. We all appreciate these are complex issues, that there are considerations, that no two cases are the same but after everything that has gone on, after all the dreadful experience, this is a unique opportunity and we in these Houses are uniquely placed to respond, to address those failings and to introduce legislation and a process that is fit for purpose and at its heart constantly shows people their information is their information. It is about saying that exchange or transaction, for want of a better word, between a person and their clinician is an equal transaction. The person is not a part of a broader system. Their sample, their cells, their biopsy or tissue material is not in a system for the sake of developing and improving a system but is instead a central part of that transaction between patient and doctor. At the heart of this is the need to ensure confidence in CervicalCheck. Central to the lack of confidence, or the hollowing out of confidence, is the experience of the scandal. Related to that was the decision to outsource cervical screening. I worked in our hospital laboratory system in advance of that decision. Through my role as a union representative, I , along with other medical scientists, could see clearly what was going to happen with cervical screening if it was outsourced. We also saw the motivation. It was a cost-saving exercise. Of course, the HSE had alternatives. It could have resourced cervical screening in Ireland but it did not. It was part of a broader strategy. At the time, we invited those private laboratories that we outsourced cervical screening to into Ireland. It was not just cervical screening that our Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government wanted to give them. It wanted to give them hospital and GP diagnostics as well. They now have facilities out on the M50. They did not come here to do private testing; they came to do public testing, and a Fianna Fáil-PD Government wanted to give it to them. It outsourced cervical screening, with detrimental impacts. Thankfully, thanks to the efforts of union representatives and workers, it did not outsource the public and GP work.  We need to re-establish confidence in the cervical screening programme by investing in and resourcing our laboratories. We need to repatriate cervical screening and bring it back. We need to do it in accredited labs. I recall the shock when people learned that many of the labs that cervical screening was outsourced to, and subsequently outsourced from the outsourced laboratories, were not accredited, but many of the laboratories in Ireland are accredited only on a voluntary basis. They are not supported or resourced adequately to be accredited. That needs to be addressed. We need to train up cytologists and we need to bring that work back to Ireland to give people confidence in it. We also need to establish this legislation and the process, to ensure that women can have confidence in the process so they know that when their cells and samples are in the system that they will have as much access to the information as their clinicians. To do that, we need a clear statutory duty of candour in the Bill.

I welcome that there seems to be some movement on the part of the Minister but the devil will be in the detail. Programmatic audits are not a new concept in the HSE or elsewhere. The question is what those programmatic audits trigger. When individual errors or issues are identified, what does that trigger? We need to be careful to recognise that these audit processes are not a new concept. They have been designed and used for the development of learning organisations, and for the improvement of systems, screening programmes or whatever else it may be, but we want a cultural change here. We want to ensure that at the heart of those system decisions is a recognition that there is a human there - a patient who is an individual - and it is her information as much as it is the learning system's information.  There is work to be done. It would be some progress to see an automatic need to notify people but we need to stress-test that with those people who have direct dreadful experience of the existing system. I hope the Minister will be open to that type of discussion in the time ahead.

The flight paths that are being operated are not the ones that were agreed. Houses were insulated to mitigate against the noise of low-flying planes. Incredibly, many of those homes are not now on the flight path, while hundreds of others, as well as schools and businesses which were never insulated, have to live with the noise nuisance of low-flying planes for hours each day. This appears to be a spectacular error by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, the IAA, and by Fingal County Council who have responsibility here. What measures is the Government taking to address this? Will the Tánaiste ensure that the DAA is not allowed to operate contrary to its permissions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-12-13 14:00:00+00:00	Current Issues Affecting the Health Services: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sinn Féin motion. I commend Deputy Cullinane on bringing it forward. We have recruitment and retention challenges across our health service, and this Government, like previous ones, has not done enough to address them. The motion states that there is a widely held belief among the public that the current Minister is incapable of addressing the crisis in our health service and, along with the wider Government, has been making the situation worse. That statement is true.  It is truer of the delivery of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath, than anywhere else. Government policy, as stated in the small hospitals framework document of 2013, is to close the Navan accident and emergency department and to downgrade the hospital to a model 2 hospital. The Minister has been made aware repeatedly of concerns about the safety of critically ill, unstable patients presenting at the Navan accident and emergency department. To state them clearly, however, those safety concerns are directly related to a chronic under-resourcing of acute and emergency services at Navan. For years staff were not recruited and not retained. Acute and emergency services were allowed by design to drift into a situation of precarity. Given the population of Meath, given the demand for emergency services in Meath from the people of Meath, given the physical distance to the next nearest emergency department, and given the state of overcrowding in those same emergency departments, there are no spare beds, no spare trolleys and no spare chairs. Adults are left waiting in the back of an ambulance, in a car park. Sick children have it even worse. They are sent out with their parents to wait in the car. It is not a situation that should be allowed to proceed.  Incredibly, despite the protestations of clinicians working on the front line - the repeated protestations of 17 consultants, to be exact - tomorrow morning a bypass protocol will be introduced at Navan and will mark the next step in the diminution of services at Navan and a step closer to the closure of the accident and emergency department there. What of those protestations? Will they say, as the motion states, that this Minister's approach and that of the Government will make matters worse? They state clearly and repeatedly that the Government's proposals and the HSE's plan will lead to worse clinical outcomes and will put lives at risk. They point to the HSE's track record in the region: repeated promises but failure to deliver. They point specifically to a bypass protocol and the fact that there are still no full-time consultants in neurology, stroke or rheumatology. As a result, the experience of the health professionals in our region, at both Navan and Drogheda hospitals, is a negative one of repeated promises but changes implemented without the necessary staffing, capacity or additional resources for our health services. The plan for Navan hospital must be one of investment and bringing it to a standard to ensure it is safe for the people of County Meath. The county has a population of in excess of 220,000 people. We know a review has been on the Minister's desk for two months at this stage. We have been very critical of its terms of reference, as the Minister knows well, but it is completely unacceptable to transfer risk from one hospital to another. Investment must be made to ensure that services are safe at Drogheda and Navan hospitals. That is the plan that must be presented and introduced. Anything other than that is a failure in my opinion.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-12-14 09:00:00+00:00	Nationalisation of Energy System: Motion [Private Members]	1	I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for tabling this motion. It gives us an opportunity to highlight how broken our electricity system is and how the privatisation and marketisation of it has failed our citizens. The failures of energy liberalisation are now widely accepted, but often not in the corridors are power. These failures are exemplified by the decline in the social value, affordability and security of our energy resources following the privatisation of our energy system. The ESB, our principal State-owned energy company, was instrumental in building that system while maintaining energy affordability. Moreover, the extent of the ESB's market share ensured the profits from energy generation in the State were heavily invested in public services for the population. Throughout the liberalisation programme, the ESB went from owning and operating 96% of the installed generation capacity in 2001 to 51%. It now holds a mere 33% share of generation in the all-island market. The systematic sell-off of our national assets was presented as an EU requirement and a means of developing more affordable electricity, neither of which was remotely true.  The pace and scale of this State’s privatisation agenda was unmatched by our European counterparts. The market share of France’s state-owned EDF reduced by a mere 6% to 83% while Sweden increased the market share of its largest generator by more than 20%. In the same timeframe, we went from having among the lowest electricity prices in Europe to the highest. Between 2000 and 2020, household electricity prices, excluding taxes and levies, increased by 274%. Additionally, the market share transfer from the State to the private sector has meant more profits from energy generation have flown into corporate dividends instead of public services and critical infrastructure.  Sinn Féin recognises that the ESB and other State bodies are central to our economic, social and environmental goals. In 2011, our finance spokesperson, Deputy Doherty, tabled a motion rejecting the privatisation of the ESB and recognising its importance to the future security and prosperity of the economy and society and to the environmental protection of the island. Unfortunately, it was not accepted and at great public cost. While we cannot turn back time, the energy transition presents an opportunity to rewire our energy system fundamentally into a more prosperous and democratic one that serves the common good.  We should not be surprised by the Minister's amendment. It is from a Government which has opposed market reforms and actively supported the current market system for an extended period. When all and sundry recognised the failures of the market, the Government, supported keenly by the Green Party, ensured reform was delayed and argued against it. As recently as August of this year, the Minister for Finance said the decoupling of gas from electricity prices would undermine investment in renewable energy and our energy transition. Of course he meant it would undermine the private profits of companies on which the Government’s idea of energy transition is fundamentally built.  We have great State agencies, such as the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna, which are in a position, if empowered, to lead our energy transformation. Sinn Féin has set out a suite of proposals to empower those agencies to do that but they are not in a position to do it because of the Government’s commitment to the market. Over the years it has driven up energy prices and created false economies at the expense of consumers. The Government has a proven track record of supporting a false system and needs to reverse that.

I am sharing time with Deputy Cronin. I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Cost of Renewables Taskforce Bill 2022 to the Dáil today. The Bill is important and would have significant implications for the cost of electricity for people. Its simple aim is to quickly establish a cross-departmental taskforce to examine the high costs of producing renewable energy here and to bring forward recommendations on ways to reduce this cost per megawatt hour. As we strive to reach 80% renewable energy generation by 2030, it is essential that the cost of producing this green electricity comes down. In our latest renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction wind energy cleared at almost €98 per megawatt hour. In other European countries prices are in the €50 range and in Spain it is even in approximately €20 per megawatt hour. Instead of coming down towards the European average, the costs in Ireland have gone up in the latest RESS auction. We need to reverse this trend and cut the cost of producing renewable energy here both to reduce household bills and to ensure Ireland is competitive to export wind energy and green hydrogen to Europe.  Delays in the planning system, the design of the auctions, commercial rates and grid connection costs are all pushing up the price of power in Ireland. The aim of this taskforce is to identify all of these contributing factors and to bring forward recommendations looking at international best practice on how to reduce the cost of producing green energy per megawatt hour.  Importantly, this Bill also mandates the taskforce to recommend mechanisms to ensure any savings made on the cost of producing renewable energy are passed onto consumers. Our transition to a zero-carbon energy system must benefit the climate and all of our citizens.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-18 12:00:00+00:00	Climate Action Plan 2023: Statements	1	I am sharing time with Deputy Cronin. I will take ten minutes and she will take five.  I welcome the opportunity afforded by these statements. I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that this is a new project, coming on the back of the sectoral emissions ceilings and the first climate action plan. It is based on documents published a couple of days before Christmas. We have not yet got the annex of actions. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is a better way to bring this forward or a better timeline in which this would not be discussed so close to Christmas and in which we would have the annexe of actions at the earliest opportunity. We have not received a hard copy of the climate action plan yet. I accept that this is a relatively new process. If there is an opportunity to improve on it, as I believe there is, let us do so.  In saying that, I acknowledge that the climate action plan itself and the annexe of actions provide a strong framework for documenting the exact measures that will be taken by Government. Whether we agree with them is a different question but they do document the measures and allow those of us in the Opposition to hold the Government to account in respect of them. I acknowledge that.  The Minister has said we are going in the wrong direction globally. We are also going in the wrong direction in Ireland as regards emissions reductions. In fact, we are not realising emissions reductions; our emissions are increasing. As time goes by, we are eating further and further into the time period of our carbon budgets and into the emissions ceilings they provide. If we continue on our current trajectory, there is a real risk that we will max out or exhaust our first carbon budget well in advance of 2025. There is significant detail in the climate action plan and a ten-minute statement will not address all of it. I will break it down into a number of areas. There is broad political consensus as regards the ambition. That is set out in the science. There is a great level of detail in the action plan and a ten-minute statement is not going to address all of it. I will break it down into several areas. There is broad political consensus regarding the ambition and this is set out in the science. There are many areas where I and my party would be critical in saying we are moving too slowly. The path in some areas we can contest, while in other areas the path is quite clear but we are moving too slowly. I will touch on some of these areas in respect of renewables. In other areas, retrofitting, for example, I will contend that we are on the wrong path and our schemes are designed incorrectly. It is the same with electric vehicles, EVs. We accept the targets and want to meet them, but the path designed by the Government is not the correct one. It is acknowledged by everybody that there is a real need for additional quality information in several areas, including land use and agriculture. Regarding the financial end of this, work is being done in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. Let us make that happen as quickly as possible.  A point that I have made to the Minister before is that I see there is a move in respect of the governance structure and accountability and new mechanisms within the Department of the Taoiseach. The Minister needs to continue to push that. There is a need for accountability within the Department of the Taoiseach but also within the individual Departments. We have seen this at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action where we have struggled to get responses and engagement from individual Departments. It is frustrating and my concern is that it shows a lack of priority in this regard within those Departments.  There needs to be an absolute focus, not by 2030 but by the end of the year. Sinn Féin published its vision for renewable energy and outlined a number of measures that need to be taken. There needs to be increased ambition regarding the proportion of community, State-owned and domestic renewables. We must empower our strong State agencies. It is great to have them. We must empower communities. We must see the guidelines updated that have been on the books for far too long. If we are to deliver on the ambition for onshore and offshore wind, we need to have community buy-in. We can achieve this if we take a particular approach. We need investment in ports, the grid and the planning system. I raise this point with the Minister regularly and I am sure he is aware of it but we need an identified workforce plan. I understand An Bord Pleanála has come forward with that. Is it up to scratch? Are those people in place? Will they be in place to deliver and assess the applications coming the Minister's way?  We need reform of the public service obligation, PSO. It is regressive between large energy users and residential energy users and also between residential energy users. The PSO needs to be reformed to ensure fairness. On retrofitting, we have published a policy and had a Dáil debate on this issue. The Minister is not taking on board the points made by me and others in the Opposition. We and the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCPC, have stated that shallow retrofit need to be introduced at pace. Up to 500,000 homes would benefit from shallow retrofits today. Far too many people cannot access schemes because they are not eligible for them or do not have the money to do so.   I appreciate that we need to scale up in respect of capacity. The Government needs to ensure the resources are applied in the most efficient and effective way possible. Sinn Féin has set out our proposals in A Fairer Retrofit Plan, which looks at taking an area-based approach. This area-based approach has been employed and I have heard that Fingal County Council has sought for it to be standard practice. In the better energy communities scheme, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has employed it, almost on a pilot basis, in Cork. This is the approach we need to take. We must identify the coldest and poorest households and retrofit those along with neighbouring homes to allow us to get through as many houses as possible, rather than retrofitting Nos. 6, 11 and 14 in one street this month and then doing Nos. 5 and 8 six months later, with everybody in between left behind. There is a possibility and need to take a fairer and more efficient approach.   Lifting people out of energy poverty is also a key priority. While I welcome the movement on the energy poverty strategy, it needs to happen at pace. It is the same with solar power. There is a great opportunity in this area. As I understand it, however, some energy providers are still not getting paid for the energy they are giving back to the system. This needs to be addressed. Again, it is an example of where the Government and the Opposition are on the same page. Why is this not happening in a timely fashion to show people the benefits and opportunities of climate action?  Regarding transport, there are great opportunities in the Connecting Ireland plan. I ask the Minister to please prioritise and resource this plan. A sum of €5 million was allocated in its first year. Sinn Féin has committed to allocating €25 million to it in year two. Let us make that happen. I have seen it implemented through the introduction of the 188 bus service. This is a route I have argued for since before I was a Teachta Dála and while still a county councillor. It has been welcomed by the community. Let us make more of this happen. This development is in stark contrast to the Navan rail line, which we are again hearing will not be delivered until 2036. That is far too slow. Communities want this rail line and will appreciate it. It would be a very positive development in the context of climate action. Let us make it happen.

I will share time with my colleagues. It is a 20-minute slot. I will take ten minutes and allow five minutes each for Deputies Cronin and Martin Browne.  I regret that the Minister is ushering through yet another Bill at breakneck speed without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. This method is becoming the norm for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. For example, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board Bill was rushed through, as was the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022. The EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 was also hurried through the Dáil and did not undergo any prelegislative scrutiny. In addition, both electricity credit Bills were brought through the Houses at speed. The Minister seems to be setting aside long-standing parliamentary process and scrutiny and ramming through legislation that has undergone very little prior examination by Deputies and Senators. An absence of prelegislative scrutiny combined with guillotined debates from this Government is a recipe for disaster. Rushing legislation can lead to bad legislation. I put on record our concern about this regular approach from the Minister.  Here we are again today, on the first day after a four-week recess, with another Bill that has not undergone prelegislative scrutiny by the climate committee, which the Government intends to ram through all Stages in a matter of weeks. This Bill would confer significant additional powers on the Minister that relate to an essential commodity that everyone in the State needs to heat their homes or power their vehicles. Section 31, nestled neatly in the last line of the Bill, seeks to confer on the Minister the power to “regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of the type or types of fuel”. That one sentence is extremely wide-ranging and would have major consequences for individuals, households, businesses and the economy. It bestows great power on one Minister. Whether we like it or not, oil remains an absolutely essential commodity so any emergency powers relating to its control and supply need to be carefully considered. Because it has not been examined in detail and the consequences have not been teased out, Sinn Féin will be submitting amendments to the Bill, one of which would require the Minister to seek Dáil approval to regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of a fuel. Sinn Féin will not be writing blank cheques for this Minister.  It is important to ask why exactly we are here. We are living in extraordinary times due to the war in Ukraine and the impact it has had on our fuel supplies and their prices. It is important to respond to that. The Government will seek to lay the entire blame on the war but that is simply not the full picture. This State remains heavily reliant on imported oil due to the failure of successive Government policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating. Over the past decade, successive governments failed to realise our potential for offshore wind power. Not one offshore wind turbine was constructed during their tenure in government. While countries like Scotland were literally laying the foundations of massive offshore wind farms, successive administrations here simply sat on their hands. I visited a Scottish wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen last year. That project alone will power 1 million homes. There is absolutely no reason Ireland could not be in the same position right now. Indeed, we should be further ahead given our extensive revenue-raising ability compared with Scotland but a lack of action and ambition over the past decade has left us trailing behind. As a result, we are reliant on imported gas and oil to keep the lights on. That is one reason the Minister is seeking these additional powers here today.  The slow pace of change to electric vehicles is another reason. Other countries, like Norway, have powered ahead with their transition to electric vehicles, EVs. For years now, Sinn Féin has being calling for alternative policies to be introduced to help to speed up the transition to EVs but these calls have not been heeded. We called for a second-hand EV grant to be introduced to help ordinary people to afford an EV, such as been done in other countries. This has been ignored. We suggested that increased grants for lower income households could be looked at. This suggestion was not taken up. We also called for the VAT and customs costs that are in place as a result of Brexit to be removed to encourage the importation of used EVs from Britain, which has, in the past, been a significant market for the importation of used cars. That was not, however, looked at. Building a second-hand EV market is important to make EVs accessible to more people on normal incomes. All three of these initiatives could be funded through reform of the existing grant scheme, which has a budget of €100 million. Reducing the value threshold of cars that qualify for grant aid, for example, would free up tens of millions of euro to be redirected to these more equitable policies, but instead the Government has been handing out grants of €5,000 to people who do not need financial help, supporting the purchase of expensive sports cars and luxury EVs and boosting the egos of multibillionaires who run many of these companies. No help or assistance has been provided to ordinary people to help them to afford an EV; quite the opposite. They are the ones who have been punished by the Government's carbon tax. It is a perfect example of the Government’s wider approach to climate action. EVs make up 20% of all cars in Norway now. In Ireland, this number is just 2.7% according to statistics from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. This is another reason the Government is seeking these emergency powers on the distribution of fuel. Its policies on EVs have failed dramatically and left us with a tiny proportion of EVs on our roads and therefore heavily reliant on imported oil, which history will tell us is a volatile commodity. We did not need to wait for the war in Ukraine to learn that.  The same can be said regarding getting people out of their private cars and onto public transport. I raised this point with the Minister earlier concerning the need to invest significantly in the rural transport plan to ensure that communities that do not have bus services get such services and that the services in those communities that have them are improved and made affordable, accessible, reliable and safe. Let us look at the Connecting Ireland plan. The scale of funding required is not there. It needs to be increased. As I said to the Minister earlier, Sinn Féin would commit €25 million to that plan in 2023. This would ensure a significant increase in the roll-out and would mean that in 2024, if the funding was matched again, the full plan would be rolled out. This would deliver significantly increased services and present people with the realistic option of leaving their cars behind. A two-car family could become a one-car family. The daily commute could be broken up, being done some days by car and other days by public transport. People will not, however, do this when they do not have that option. Another reason we are here and we are so dependent on oil and liquid fuels is because of a failure to roll out public transport.  The same can be said when it comes to residential heating. Homes across Ireland are still reliant on burning oil to keep warm, because the Government's retrofitting plan has and is bypassing them. These households cannot afford to upgrade their heating systems, as the Government's retrofitting plan is inequitable and inaccessible. Over the past decade, shallow retrofits fell by 88%, resulting in lost heat and a higher demand for oil to keep warm. Failed policies on retrofitting mean burning oil to keep warm is still a reality for far too many people, and this further increases our reliance on imported fuels. While the war in Ukraine might be the handiest excuse to hand for the Minister, in reality failed policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating have all contributed to our massive reliance on imported oil and left this State and our people worryingly exposed to imported fuel. We need policy change in the area of offshore wind in order to accelerate it and this must involve widespread State ownership. We need policy change with regard to EVs to support ordinary people, with regard to residential heating to have a fair and equitable retrofitting plan and with regard to public transport to ensure people have access to such transport. In terms of more sustainable residential heating systems, Sinn Féin has asked the Minister to explore the use of hydrotreated vegetable oil, or HVO, as a cleaner alternative for home heating. HVO, which can be used in traditional home heating oil boilers, cuts emissions by between 80% and 90% compared to home heating oil.   We will submit amendments to this Bill and continue to engage with this process. We have concerns regarding this legislation. We recognise that it is necessary but there is much more than can and should be done.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-24 14:00:00+00:00	Forestry Sector: Motion [Private Members]	10	To be clear, this is a bad deal for Ireland. It is spelled out. It is a bad deal for Ireland because it will increase the price of land. More importantly, it reflects a complete lack of vision on behalf of the Government. There is no strategy. Forget about strategy; there is a lack of vision. There is an opportunity here to bring communities with us and what is the Government doing instead? It is isolating them and alienating them. It is completely unacceptable but it is no surprise at all, given there is a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and their ideological partners in the Green Party.  Communities are being isolated. Farmers are being isolated. The price of land is being driven up. There is a real opportunity in forestry, and the Government does not have to imagine where communities are, because there has been a Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity Loss. The Department has consulted with communities. It has spelled it out in the public attitudes presented in the survey on forestry. Communities want to play their part. They want forestry in urban and rural areas. They want it to be alive. They want a richness in biodiversity. Instead, what are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party doing? They are selling it off for corporate profit and shame on them all. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-25 09:10:00+00:00	Communications Regulation Bill 2022: Instruction to Committee	1	I will share time with Deputy Ó Murchú. I welcome this motion and thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward. We will have an opportunity later on Report Stage to have further discussion on it. I commend those involved on getting us to this point. This has been a particular focus of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications. There have been numerous debates in this House over the last number of years regarding the future viability and sustainability of our post office network. I commend the Ministers and the Departments, particularly the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, and their representatives, who engaged with representatives across the political spectrum in a range of forums and put their case strongly and clearly forward regarding what they saw as needed to ensure the viability of the network.  In other areas, issues came up during debates and were raised by representative groups and An Post regarding offline services. There was an inter-departmental review. Enough is not coming from that as regards offline services. I support the proposition that there is significant opportunity for An Post and post offices to deliver offline services. This is particularly the case in the area of ID verification. The post office service has the technology, the physical footprint in the communities the length and breadth of Ireland and there remains significant opportunity in those areas.  My colleague will pick up on more recent developments in respect of the price of stamps and other matters but I will conclude by saying that I welcome the motion, look forward to the debate later on, and more importantly, look forward to this funding being distributed to the post office network in a fair manner to ensure the viability of it. That will be matter which will need constant review, update and engagement because the post office network is of great importance to communities for so many reasons.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	questions	English	2023-01-26 08:50:00+00:00	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	1	The Minister, in response to my colleague, Deputy Doherty, earlier, said he wants to smash the housing targets. I am not sure whether he has told the Office of the Planning Regulator about that or amended the national planning framework or told a single local authority in the State. In Meath, we have a track record of delivering houses but there are nowhere near enough. The Meath County Council housing delivery action plan targets are shy by 2,000 out to 2027 and there will be more people going onto the housing list than houses being built. To buy a house in the private market, people are looking at in excess of €485,000 for a three-bedroom property. We are ahead of the game in regard to our county development plan but as soon as it was adopted, it was out of date because it was based on the 2016 census figures and population projections that were grossly underestimated, although they were the basis for the national planning framework, NPF. For example, the town of Dunshaughlin could grow by 6,000 people up to 2027 and there are 8,500 people there already. Will the Minister immediately review the housing targets for County Meath and ensure they are consistent with national, regional and local plans?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-26 08:50:00+00:00	Forestry Strategy: Statements	1	"I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this subject again. I also spoke during Sinn Féin's Private Members' motion, which made three concrete proposals. Deputy Carthy has touched on a number of them, those being, licensing and how the State can get itself off the hook in the Coillte deal. In my comments, I will focus on the forestry strategy.  Sinn Féin's Private Members' business called for the publication of a forestry strategy as a matter of urgency and for it to prioritise afforestation undertaken by local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures, which is the model of delivery that should be at the strategy's heart. In his concluding remarks, the Minister referred to the Government's approach and said: The second part is that we publish our new forest strategy as soon as possible, and an ambitious one. This is what we will be doing. We are working on finalising that at the moment and it will be a really good forestry strategy to go with the unprecedented high premium rate that we already announced just before Christmas. There was no mention of the delivery mechanism or the prioritisation of local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures. That should come as no surprise.  There is agreement that we need an ambitious plan for forestry, but the Government seems to be ignoring it, which is the disappointing element. There is an agreed vision of what the future of forestry should look like. Indeed, the Department conducted an extensive public consultation using surveys, various deliberative models and stakeholder engagement, and prepared a summary report of the result. What does the citizenry say when we speak to it about the future of forestry? There is a wisdom in crowds, as there always is. Regarding Ireland's ambition for forest creation, and according to the report, citizens recognise: 1. The current level of forest cover in Ireland is too low and there is an urgent need for a greater level of ambition. 2. Ireland needs a major expansion of new forests, to where there is a greater balance with traditional agriculture in the landscape. 3. Land availability is a critical element to any future increase in forest cover. 4. A significant shift in land use change is needed and will require much better integration of trees and forests with traditional farming and agricultural practices. 5. There needs to be a regulatory system in place that can deal efficiently and effectively with the requirements of forest establishment and management. 
             1. Climate change is a key driver for increasing forest cover. 2. Combating climate change should be a priority objective when planning new and managing existing forests. 3. Forest carbon accounting will be a key tool to understanding the climate change impact of the forest sector and to informing decisions on future land use planning, 4. Increasing the use of wood and wood products, both as a long-term store of carbon and as a substitute to using more carbon intensive products are key ways that forests can contribute to meeting our climate targets. 5. There is a preference [among the citizenry] for managing forests in a way that addresses climate change. People want forests in urban and rural areas. According to the report: 1. There is generally a very positive attitude toward forests in Ireland and they are an important natural resource for urban and rural communities, using them regularly for recreation and health and wellbeing [sic]. 2. Continued access to public forests is vital to maintain the benefits of forests to people. There is a general divergence in preference for access to publicly or privately owned forests ... 5. Continued and improved engagement and communication with forest owners and farmers is essential to maintaining good working relationships and building confidence and trust. I have more to go through, but it already seems that if the Department, Minister and Minister of State actually listened to the public consultation that they conducted, they would not have landed themselves where they are.  The consultation continues: 2. There is a preference to see more wood products used in the construction of Irish houses an in energy generation ... 5. There is a need for wider education and awareness raising on the benefits of wood and timber products. Using forests for nature shows a major gap in the Government's approach. The consultation reads: 1. Supporting and protecting nature and biodiversity are key drivers for increasing forest cover and planning and managing existing forests. 2. There is a preference for expanding, enhancing and restoring native woodland habitats. 3. Establishing non-native conifer forests on sensitive peatland habitats is a key concern. The existing biodiversity and climate mitigation value of candidate afforestation sites should be an important consideration in this regard. 4. A diversity of approaches to forest establishment and management should be used in support of nature ... 
             1. There is a preference among the public for more diverse mixed forests and native forests. 2. The urgent need to create more forests should not be used as a reason to continue planting less diverse forests ... 
             1. People would like to see more forests established on a mix of private and public lands and in urban and near-urban areas ... 
             2. There is an interest at community level to facilitate greater community involvement in forest establishment and management ... 4. Using a suite of options in encouraging more farmers to plant trees will be important. Nowhere in the above did the citizenry say that we should develop a complex market mechanism and use investment funds to buy up tranches of private land to deliver corporate profit. Rather, the people have said that they want a model of forestry that delivers for local communities, the environment, farmers and the economy. Indeed, this is the same sentiment that came from the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss last week. The Government has landed somewhere entirely different, though.  There has been extensive discussion of the Coillte deal, which is a bad deal for Ireland. Today in the  [The commission] has previously drawn attention to risks of inappropriate afforestation of sensitive habitats such as peatlands and negative effects on areas of high ecological value ... I will draw a connection. When the Government consulted the people of Ireland, they said exactly the same thing as the European Commission did. The  The [strategic environmental assessment] report also does not ... adequately address concerns about the piecemeal encroachment of forestry plantations and roads into open landscapes under high natural value farming and relied upon by open habitat birds, notably the hen harrier and the breeding curlew. Breeding curlew numbers have collapsed from an estimated 3,300-5,500 pairs in the late 1980s to no more than 150 pairs at present. There is an agreed vision - my party certainly reflects it - in the report of the public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. The Government is failing miserably to deliver on it."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-02-15 09:12:00+00:00	Energy Costs and Windfall Taxes: Motion [Private Members]	1	I welcome the motion and the specific proposals to introduce targeted price caps and a windfall tax, review the proposed revenues from non gas and electricity generators and leave the Energy Charter Treaty. Sinn Féin has advocated an energy price freeze for some months. It is welcome that the Social Democrats support that move. It would provide certainty and the maximum protection for consumers. Coupled with a windfall tax, it is the most effective way to tackle the disgusting profits and practices of big energy companies.  An energy price break has been introduced in several EU member states. Over the Christmas break, energy price caps for 2023 were introduced in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in Austria, France, Luxembourg and Poland. The question of it undermining conservation could easily be addressed in a number of ways such as, for example, applying the price break only to average household electricity consumption or a household's consumption the previous year, as is the case in the design of the scheme in Germany.  The Government will not oppose the motion, but has no intention of introducing an energy price cap because, time and again, when push comes to shove and action is measured over spin, it will protect the profits of big energy companies. After all, it was the greatest opponent of energy windfall taxes despite the fact that Shell announced $40 billion in profit last year, the highest in 115 years. BP announced profits of $28 billion and Exxon Mobil profits of $56 billion. Closer to home, Vermilion, the operators of Corrib gas, made $102 million in one quarter. They are eye-watering figures. While hiking charges for ordinary customers Centrica, or Bord Gáis, said its earnings in 2022 will be eight times its 2021 earnings. Energia increased its profits by 50% in 2022. ESB made €390 million in the first six months of last year. This is simply obscene.  The Government opposed market reforms as a European level. When the EU toolbox provided for price caps and windfall taxes as far back as October 2020, the Government stood steadfast in opposition to it. In June 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said it was the wrong move. In August 2022, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said windfall taxes would undermine Irish energy independence. Such is the paucity of vision from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party that they could not see that and act on behalf of ordinary consumers. Instead, they are eventually brought kicking and screaming when the European Union moves. That is a feature of every intervention the Government makes. It is the last one to move in the European Union. It will not lead; it will follow and resist positive proposals.

I will read the Minister's words back to him. He said if a decision is made for a co-ordinated exit of EU member states from the treaty, Ireland will support that position and withdraw. It is the same in respect of windfall taxes. While the Iberian countries of Spain and Portugal moved, the Government resisted that. Today, instead of delivering €1.9 billion, he has told us the windfall tax will deliver €280 million because of his delay.

It is useful to benefit from their experience. Will Dr. Torney speak to his third point and his opinion that there appears to be no obligation on the Climate Change Advisory Council to recommend that the Government approve carbon budgets that are consistent with the national 2050 climate objective? There was some discussion yesterday on these issues and the absence of interim targets. The 2050 targets seem to be the only targets. An opinion was expressed that there is enough in Government policy and the carbon budgets will provide a strong basis for those targets to be met.  Dr. Torney noted that the Climate Change Advisory Council is strengthened in the Bill. Will Dr. Ryall speak to the issue of public involvement and participation and whether the advisory council meets the bar set by the Citizens' Assembly? How might it be improved? Would another vehicle be more appropriate?

My question is for Dr. Glynn. Recommendation No. 12 in his submission calls for the Bill to explicitly define the method used to calculate the warming effect of each greenhouse gas as a proportion of the carbon budget and which gases, if any, will not be included in the carbon budgets. The Climate Change Advisory Council has recommended a split national target for 2050, with net zero emissions of long-lived gases and a separate volume of biogenic methane. Will Dr. Glynn comment on which gases he thinks should or should not be included? Should they be explicitly outlined in the legislation before us? He also referred earlier to gases which are appropriate for inclusion in short-term five-year carbon budgets but not in longer term budgets. Will Dr. Glynn comment on those points?

There is considerable overlap in the contributions and questions. I can see weakness in the Bill reflected in many of the comments, including the lack of emphasis on just transition. We are left with the conundrum of how we should include it in the legislation. What is the appropriate way to do it? Are there international comparisons? Scotland was mentioned. I would like to hear the witnesses' perspectives on that. To what extent should we seek to include just transition? Should it be running through the document or should a specific section capture it? For example, should it be referenced in the make-up of the climate council? Participation is a point that has come up repeatedly. What work needs to be done to include that participatory element with specific reference to just transition? Those are questions for the witnesses from NESC.  I ask Professor Anderson to speak about Ireland's global responsibility and his point about global carbon budgets. Obviously, just transition has a particular context for workers in the sector and people in fuel poverty, but we sit in a global context.

Can Mr. Carroll outline the process from here of the implications of the EU COMs or proposals now before the committee on our obligations if we know what these are, or how do we find out what these are, or if they are changing at all? I noticed that there is reference to the target now shifting to at least 55% by 2030 which is to be Europe-wide. I presume there will be different obligations on different countries and there is also reference to a starting point. There is some indication that Ireland, being somewhat of a climate laggard, might have to do a little bit less of the lifting. Can Mr. Carroll indicate the process and the implications, if we know what they are, as to our obligations and also inform us as to the preparation of the climate Bill and other related legislation as it exists that might be changed on the back of these COMs?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-09 13:00:00+00:00	Engagement with Chairperson Designate of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	1	I offer congratulations to Mr. Byrne and wish him well in what is an important role. We are all hoping to see significant progress in the time ahead.  In regard to his plans, I ask him to comment in regard to the design of the various schemes with a view to targeting those areas and those homes most in need. It seems to be the case that many of the schemes are demand-led, so they are open for people to avail of them but they are not necessarily correlated with those areas of greatest need. Mr. Byrne mentioned SEAI is working closely with the Department around mapping out the work programme for the time ahead. Will that be informed by socioeconomic status, household income or the R rating, and what will inform that work? Does Mr. Byrne see a need to prioritise those areas in greatest need? Are there plans, for example, to revisit households that have already been visited? We still deal with this issue around the single household visit. I know many constituents who need more work completed but the bureaucratic criteria mean that does not happen.  In regard to the engagement with communities, I ask Mr. Byrne for comment in regard to sustainable energy communities, SECs. What plans has the SEAI to increase the level of sustainable energy communities? Are there any plans to engage with An Post, the GAA or local sporting and cultural organisations to see greater roll-out of those works?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-09 13:00:00+00:00	Engagement with Chairperson Designate of the ESB	1	I thank Mr. O'Rourke. I have just a couple of questions. There was news related to the ESB in the newspapers at the weekend regarding borrowing limits and the joint venture with Coillte. Could he outline the significance of this and what it facilitates the ESB to do in terms of its renewables ambition and its significance in Ireland in the future? Is it onshore or offshore? What will it look like? Is it wind or solar? There are challenges around wind development onshore. I am thinking particularly of the ongoing call for the wind farm guidelines to be updated in some way to manage the tensions between developers and communities. I ask Mr. O'Rourke to comment on that.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-23 13:00:00+00:00	Decarbonising Transport: Discussion	1	I thank all the witnesses. I have two brief questions as I am conscious of the time. The first is to Dr. O'Mahony. I am interested in his opinions on the potential for the expansion of rail. There are a number of proposals for expanding and improving the services and the infrastructure but many of them fail to meet the cost benefit analysis threshold of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Does he believe our tools for assessing these projects are suitably robust to appreciate and estimate the true value of rail?  The second question is to Mr. Cussen. I ask him to speak to his powers of enforcement or the opportunity to improve the policy or regulatory or legislative tools available to deliver on the national planning framework or the compact proposals. He mentioned a number of pieces in his opening statement. He touched on the national brownfield and infill development land register, the Land Development Agency Bill, the vacant and derelict sites legislation and also the dispatch of litigation. He might comment on those matters.  Finally, will he expand on the point in terms of renewable energy? He mentioned the need for the updated wind energy guidelines, which is something I have raised repeatedly with the Minister. I see communities in conflict with planners on a regular basis in respect of renewable energy. Where does he see the opportunity to resolve that with his proposal for a spatial plan?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-02-23 13:00:00+00:00	Decarbonising Transport: Discussion	2	Yes.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-03-09 12:30:00+00:00	Decarbonising Transport: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank our witnesses for their presentations. With regard to the scale of the transformational change that is needed, perhaps Dr. Torney will say a word on controversy around planning and the planning system and if he has any comments on the types of approaches. I note he referred to different deliberative forums for engaging the population on the type of change that is needed on transportation. Is there a model that might best suit that?  Ms Graham has experience with major transport reform through BusConnects and in other areas. I ask her to comment on that experience and whether she sees an opportunity to improve the planning process to deliver on the type of reforms that are needed. Perhaps she could also comment on the National Transport Authority's capacity. In fairness, there is huge ambition on the part of the Government. What is the nature of the change for the NTA and how does the future look for the NTA in the context of the organisation and its capacity?  Will Dr. Caulfield address the issue of travel to school and the modal shift? What are his ideas and suggestions on opportunities to get people to move away from car transport to schools? Many of the journeys to school by car are comparatively short distances. Does this offer an opportunity to deliver a modal shift in a significant way? Does Dr. Caulfield have ideas or recommendations on that?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-03-09 12:30:00+00:00	Decarbonising Transport: Discussion (Resumed)	2	I refer to my question regarding the capacity of the NTA.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-03-23 12:30:00+00:00	Decarbonising Transport: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I will try to be brief with my questions. It strikes me that we have well established structures for finding and delivering solutions to roads problems. Could Dr. Sloman speak about her experience in Newport and the road in Cardiff Airport, as the Chair mentioned? We have many examples in Ireland, and I presume elsewhere, of real problems with congestion on a daily basis. The solutions which are proposed and most often delivered are wider and bigger roads. I am interested to know whether there is a practical example of an occasion where there was a roads solution on the table and an alternative was delivered. In my experience, most people want congestion removed and their lived experience improved on. I am interested in that. Do the witnesses believe there is a need for a mindset change, a governance change or a governmental change in terms of our Departments' assessment tools, and the training of our transport professionals to achieve that mindset change and consideration of the new dispensation?  What is the comparative experience of Dr. Sloman and Dr. Windisch in Britain and internationally? The Irish challenge relates to the geographically dispersed nature of many of our communities. We have a particular challenge in the geographical distribution of our communities in which we have low density. Would the witnesses have any suggestions taking the comparison between London and Wales, for example, of policy priorities? What should we be looking at and are there good international examples? Does it involve school or bus transport, car sharing, demand for transport or something else?  Can Professor McKinnon speak about the development of the technology for batteries and hydrogen for freight, and the performance, availability and affordability of that? I note there was a significant Government incentive and support for the sector here in recent days, which was well received by the sector. Are there other examples of similar interventions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-27 09:30:00+01:00	Increasing Wind Power on the National Grid: Discussion	1	I have a few questions for whoever might like to take them. On future development for communities around the country, how many additional onshore wind farms might we expect to see across the Twenty-six Counties before 2030? I would just like some sense of that situation. Turning to public acceptance, I would like to hear the perspective of the witnesses regarding that aspect. We had the planning regulator in with us some weeks ago and he talked about the possibility of designated areas for renewable energy. He also referred to there almost being an effective ban in policy in some counties.  From my experience, I know the great public resistance there can be concerning what is seen as opportunistic development that is not well thought through and not well connected with communities. I ask the witnesses to comment on that point about public acceptance. The wind energy guidelines are still outstanding as well and I ask if the witnesses have opinions on that aspect from their experience.  Representatives from EirGrid will be appearing before the committee in the next hour. There is some sense that EirGrid's ambition is not what it should be. I note the wide range of proposals that Wind Energy Ireland has in respect of policy development which would have to change to meet our 2030 targets. Will the witnesses comment on the ongoing EirGrid public consultation and the type of submission Wind Energy Ireland will be making to that consultation?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-04-27 09:30:00+01:00	Increasing Wind Power on the National Grid: Discussion	2	I want to come back to the issue of the North-South interconnector with Mr. Foley. I have questions on pylon procurement and access to lands. I do not believe Mr. Foley answered the questions on access to lands as raised by Deputy Carthy. How does EirGrid propose to get access to lands given the community resistance? Has pylon procurement begun? What stage is that at?  On the overall approach to the North-South interconnector in the context of shaping our electricity future EirGrid said: We cannot achieve this ambition on our own. We need support across a vast range of stakeholders, but particularly in the community and political domains. The North-South interconnector is a blueprint of exactly what not to do. It is deeply insulting for the communities who are watching this to hear from Mr. Foley in his position that EirGrid has the facts and they have a lot of noise. It actually goes to the root of the problem here. Will Mr. Foley acknowledge that the facts are disputed? The facts have changed over the years. This is the problem and it is fundamental to what is at stake. The local communities are deeply offended by the approach taken by EirGrid and by the Government. There is a solution. It involves real and meaningful engagement, which has not happened to date.  What role will EirGrid have in the review? Has contact been made by the Government, by the Department or by the Minister on the review? In 2006 and 2007, when was it estimated that the North-South interconnector would be operational? In 2021, when is it estimated that the North-South interconnector will be operational? To what degree is community opposition taken into account?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-05-04 12:30:00+01:00	Reduction of Carbon Emissions of 51% by 2030: Discussion	1	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. A lot of what I was going to raise has been raised. It is interesting to hear the level of agreement on the analysis, the diagnosis, and the range of perverse incentives and contradictions within schemes. I share the opinion of many of the contributors. In my experience of communities, and working with communities, they are far ahead of the Government and certainly policy when it comes to these issues. If anything, local government and policy can be an impediment to what communities want to deliver and achieve in terms of the type of environment they want to live in whether that is urban or rural.  Dr. Lysaght, in his opening statement, commented on roadside policy. I am the transport spokesperson for my party. Does he think there is an opportunity in terms of the motorway network for the likes of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and other national and local roads authorities, to improve biodiversity along roadsides?  How would the three witnesses like to see the overwhelming public goodwill towards biodiversity harnessed and mobilised in support of policy? Do they think there are platforms outside of the institutions that we have here such as the Citizens' Assembly, local citizen juries and community groups? How do they think we can mobilise the popular support that we see in schools and Tidy Towns groups right across the board?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	1	Would it not have been a legitimate approach in this year to treat late applications differently from those who applied before 29 April? We have a scenario where people who applied after 29 April, eligible and concessionary, have been accommodated ahead of those who applied before 29 April. I think that would have been a fair approach and I know there are specific eligibility criteria. Was that an option the Minister considered? Was it ruled out and, if so, why was it ruled out?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	2	It would not have been mid-stream.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	3	However, the closing date for applications was 29 April.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	4	Why did the Department not consider applications received before 29 April first and then fill the remaining seats with applications received after 29 April? That would not have involved changing criteria. It would have been a fair approach.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	5	However, the Minister has moved the goalposts by deciding the deadline was not 29 April, but rather 29 July. The Minister could have-----

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	7	The Minister stated approximately 600 eligible applicants have not yet been accommodated.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	8	What is the Minister's intention as regards accommodating those 600 applicants? Obviously they must be accommodated. When does the Minister think they will be accommodated? What are the challenges in doing that? The Chair mentioned that transport contractors have said this year is very different from last year. I know a number of them. They had buses laid up last year. This year they are coming towards the end of a busy tourism season. Does the Minister intend to accommodate the 6,000 applicants or the approximately 600 remaining concessionary ticket applicants? What are the financial and practical challenges of accommodating the 6,000? I expect that significant challenges exist in providing buses and drivers. Is the Minister considering increasing the 70-year-old threshold?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-21 09:30:00+01:00	School Transport Issues: Engagement with Minister for Education	9	Does the Minister know how many of the 6,000 applicants for concessionary tickets are people who were previously accommodated on buses?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-09-28 12:30:00+01:00	Energy Charter Treaty, Energy Security, Liquefied Natural Gas and Data Centres: Discussion	1	I might ask Dr. Tienhaara about the ECT. In her most recent contribution she said there is no positive benefit for the public from the ECT. If that is the case, I wonder what she would suggest if she was advising the Government or the Minister on it. A number of European colleagues have called on the European Union to withdraw from the treaty. Is that something Dr. Tienhaara would support or is there another way around it, be it reform or something else? I would be interested in her opinion on that.  I have another question for Dr. Bresnihan and Dr. Carton. It appears that there is a significant information deficit on data centres and the call for a moratorium makes sense to me. There are a number of scientific, technological, political and ethical considerations, and it is as if there is an information deficit in respect of almost every one of them. I want to ask about mitigation because that has been argued for from some quarters. What are the witnesses' experiences of the type of mitigation measures that could be used? There are conditions for offsetting and generation; do they work well elsewhere and is there potential in this? Is it possible, as has been said to me before, that these data centres could be net contributors to the grid if their uninterruptible power supply, UPS, or backup storage could be tapped into? Is there international experience of this or is that fanciful?

To return to the critical reliance on fossil fuels and the potential need for them into the future, he stated that a move away is technically feasible, although it would require decisive policy measures to be brought about. He went on to say we would need almost to build a separate firm with a dispatchable, instantaneous supply. Does he foresee that future involving hydrogen battery storage? What technology does he foresee filling that gap whereby we now rely on coal, gas and other fossil fuels as a critical backup? At what stage is that technology now in its development? What can Ireland do to be a leader in grasping the opportunity to make that transition as quickly as possible?

I have a couple of questions. Many people looking in will wonder how we have ended up in a situation in 2021 where we could not get assurances from very senior Ministers last week that we would not have blackouts. I appreciate that we have received some more information today.  I am interested in the relationship with the providers and the lessons they say they have learned in terms of the regulator. They pointed to a number of issues they say have been identified, such as ancillary infrastructure, policy signals and statutory processes. Can the witnesses give an example of what the suppliers are saying in regard to each of those that are an issue? How are they responding? Are they going to the Government? There is a concern that fossil fuel producers might be telling the regulator they do not like the policy intention of the Government. Will the regulator give some examples of how he is responding to that?  I ask about lessons. An emergency plan initiated between the regulator and EirGrid was scrapped. Separate to that, renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions were due to be annual but did not happen this year. What is the reason for that?  For EirGrid, where are the pressure points in the grid? Is it Dublin or west Dublin in particular? EirGrid indicated that other plants might come down in the weeks ahead. Where are those?  I ask for an update on the North-South interconnector, which is critical infrastructure. There is a judicial review in the North and an ongoing Government-led review in the South. I ask, as I asked last time EirGrid was here, whether the pylons have been procured. If so, are they in the country? Is EirGrid engaging with local authorities? How does EirGrid intend to access land without landowners' agreement?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-10-07 17:30:00+01:00	General Scheme of the Circular Economy Bill 2021: Discussion	1	I will be brief. On the issue of food waste prevention, should the case be made that the mandatory reduction targets be set statutorily because at present they are not? I am concerned we will have waste management plans that will consistently miss their targets. A number of people have raised the need to set targets and to have a regime of enforcement. Is there a case to be made for the mandatory reporting by food businesses on the amount of food waste they generate and the actions taken to reduce such waste? As we have to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030, some argue that a mandatory 7% food waste reduction target should be set each year. That would require the setting of year-on-year food waste prevention targets and the establishment of an regime to enforce them.  A number of people have raised the issue of product obsolescence. Perhaps this cannot be tackled at an Irish level, but is there anything that can be done to address that issue because it is a fundamental issue of importance in a circular economy? There are many examples of unnecessary waste that relate specifically to product obsolescence.  On construction and demolition waste, does this legislation provides particular opportunities for us to improve our performance in this regard? In my area of County Meath, each year we deal with illegal dumping on an industrial scale for which the State and the taxpayer pick up the tab. This occurs on the one hand while on the other hand there is a regime that lacks the level of regulation that is required. From speaking to people in local authorities, I know of the challenges they face keeping on top of requests for licences.  I have a related question which perhaps cannot be dealt with by the legislation. It strikes me that this Bill could result in a significant demand for increased resources, be that from the Environmental Protection Agency or local authorities, in regard to enforcement. Has that been factored into the Department's preparations to date?

They are very helpful in terms of the committee's work-through of this legislation, which is really important.  The scale of the challenge was mentioned. There are many like-minded people on this committee, but I wonder sometimes about the barriers to the implementation of this type of measure. As mentioned earlier, there is a cohort out there who are completely on board and doing this stuff already, but is only a tin percentage of people. How do we scale up in terms of the population as a whole? In her opening statement, Ms O'Brien mentioned convenience and what creates it. Does she have an opinion on how we can scale up reuse and on the piece in terms of convenience? The latter is a reality in terms of the type of lives people live. In Ireland, one needs two people in employment to purchase a house. Those who have children are juggling much of the time. People are back commuting having not had to do so for more than a year.   We need to get this legislation right. There are elements of it on which we need to hear from the witnesses and others to make it stronger. In the Irish experience and in the international experience, are there other elements that need to come with this in terms of work-life balance, a four-day working week, public awareness and so on? What other elements need to come with this measure to create the environment where these types of system changes can happen? I accept that is a broad question.  The other piece for Ms O'Brien and Mr. Schweitzer is the role of the State and its agencies in terms of being a leader in this area. I worked in the health service for a long time. The opportunity there to be a leader in terms of managing waste is massive in terms of the €22 billion budget and the level of consumption in terms of disposables. I worked in laboratories, where the amount of waste generated was incredible. Is there an opportunity for the State to be a leader in this area?

It has been very informative for me. It is very interesting to hear the witnesses' perspectives and experiences. What they are saying really chimes with our climate obligations. It is interesting to hear that farmers have a willingness in this regard. I can see it in my area, and how we can point towards the new opportunities and new ways of farming. I wonder then why we are not making so much progress. I wonder why the debate is so toxic. Perhaps we could get a sense from the witnesses of this. There is such a commonality in the presentations and a shared analysis around where we are and where we need to get to. There is a lot of detail that I have not yet got my head fully around regarding the frameworks that could make that happen, including results-based payments and so on.  I have a few questions and I hope to afford the witnesses the opportunity to share some of their frustrations on where they believe the barriers are. I have a question on scale. I am conscious that a lot of this is pilot projects. We have lots of pilot projects and for some reason a lot of it does not scale up. What are the barriers to scaling up these initiatives? What needs to happen in the next short number of months for these types of initiatives to be scaled up?  On the CAP strategic plan, what are the witnesses assessment of CAP? There is an idea that farmers will respond to incentives. There is an argument that maybe the incentives have been the wrong ones. Does this reflect the wrong set of values at a European Union level or a national level, and does this continue on in the current CAP? Is the current CAP large enough or is it a smaller pie than previously? Is it the case that CAP has been repurposed?  The witnesses have spoke about engagement. This issue has come up time and again. During planning for carbon budgets, were the witnesses' organisations consulted, formally or informally, on the development of the upcoming climate action plan?

I suspect a conspiracy. That is all right. The Minister will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow, where I will surely raise the matter of broadband. I thank him for his time.  Much has been covered. I have some comments on the process here, the carbon budgets as they relate to sectoral ceilings, and the committee's role in that. I am conscious that if we take the low end of the carbon budget ranges in the climate action plan, we do not meet the 51% target. Will the Minister comment on that?  I went to the launch of the national dialogue. I hope he will agree that this is an iterative approach. We are in a rush. My understanding is that these documents are nearly always in draft form and changing. Engagement needs to be the cornerstone of this. I hope he will test it with regard to not just how many we have engaged with but also who we have not heard from. That question needs to be asked constantly. The bar is high. Maybe it is unattainable but we should strive towards it.  Regarding offshore wind, there is concern in certain quarters that there is not sufficient ambition and that there is opportunity to do more over the period, especially for floating offshore wind. I would be interested in the Minister's perspective. One of the national newspapers published an article last week. Britain is using that technology. Should we use the same?  There is a need to front-load ambition to connect rural Ireland. I have a final question about overall funding. I hear what the Minister has to say about retrofitting. There is a spectacular challenge. The private sector might get us some of the way. We need to generate a demand that is not there yet. Coming out of COP26, are green bonds or other international instruments being considered?

What does Mr. Cooke think next year might look like in respect of the electric vehicle market? I ask him to speak to some of the supply issues and what the situation might look like from January to July next year regarding advanced purchases and orders. Does he have an opinion concerning how the uptake of EVs in areas of high car dependency might be increased? I presume many sales of EVs occur in the Dublin and greater Dublin area and many other urban areas around the country. We have, though, and will continue to have, much higher car dependency in more rural areas as well, where we tend to see less of an uptake of EVs. Are there particular measures that Mr. Cooke would see as being beneficial in addressing that situation? In addition, could he elaborate on his point concerning the role of the State in the context of the EV fleet? The State has been poor in its own purchasing of EVs. I ask Mr. Cooke to expand on the point he made in his opening statement in that regard. I also ask him to reflect on the second-hand market. Is the case that he thinks it may be the back end of the decade before we see a real second-hand market for EVs?  Turning to Ms Sayers, what is the target for EV infrastructure? Approximately 1,800 charging points are in place now. I am not sure if they are all the ESB’s. Is the target approximately 30,000? I think I heard that figure mentioned previously. Does Ms Sayers have a sense of the breakdown in that regard between home and public chargers? From her presentation, it seemed to be the case that the ESB is reacting to demand as opposed to installing an infrastructure to induce demand. Does she have an opinion regarding the role of the State in oversight? In addition, does she have a timeline for the roll-out of infrastructure over the months and years to come?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-30 15:00:00+00:00	Electric Vehicles: Discussion	2	I ask Dr. O'Tuama and Dr. Byrne to comment on the supports available for e-bikes and e-cargo bikes. I do not think there is subsidy support for cargo bikes. Is there a sense that the support subsidies are sufficient in that regard, or should they be extended to other types of bikes?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-11-30 15:00:00+00:00	Electric Vehicles: Discussion	3	Well, if we need to come back to these questions the second time around, I will not mind. I leave it to the Chair to decide.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-11 12:00:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion	1	I thank the witnesses for all their work and for attending the meeting today. I have a number of questions but I may ask some of them in later rounds. I want to focus on the issue of the models. First, I would like to know about the information gaps, the data sets and the input variables. What gaps were there when the witnesses started their work and what gaps or weaknesses in information remain? I have a similar question about the models themselves. This is pioneering work and we are all very grateful for it. It is hugely important because what comes out the back end of it has a real significance and impact on policy and people's lives. I ask the witnesses for some critical reflection on the models we are using. There are three, as I understand it, as well as various submissions from other parties. What are the strengths of the models and what are their limitations or weaknesses? Those might relate specifically to the models or the information going into them. I also have a question about the future. Do the witnesses envisage that we will end up with a unified model, or will we continue with the focus on energy, agriculture and land use?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-11 12:00:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion	2	I have a question on the assessment of the investment required for transition. I am looking at the technical report. How was that assessed? Table 3.4 has reference to taking €5 billion as the average per annum upfront investment required. Where does that €5 billion come from? On my read of the 51% reduction, it looks more like €10 billion. I seek information on that as to whether I am reading it the wrong way round.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-13 13:30:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank the Chairman and witnesses for their presentation and written submission. I will address a similar theme. One of the points that came up in a number of the contributions we heard from academic experts yesterday, the subgroup of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, on Tuesday, and the witnesses today is the potential social impact of the developed models. There is a weakness with every model. I ask the witnesses to assess the potential social impact of change, the gaps in information and the type of work we need to do to fill those gaps. I also ask them to comment on the issue of bringing communities with us. They mentioned participatory research, which may be the way to go, but my question is on scaling that up. We are obviously in a rush here. Time is of the essence and we are hearing we need to act very quickly. Is there time for continuous pilot studies or do we need to scale this up? If that can be done, what will it look like?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-13 13:30:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion (Resumed)	2	I want to pick up on a NESC paper, Economic Resilience in Sustainable Communities, with a view to moving towards action and alternative economic models. There was some reference to the community wealth building model as an alternative sustainable and participative economic model. Do the witnesses want to comment?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-13 13:30:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion (Resumed)	3	I thank the Chairman and our witnesses. I have a question for each of the groups so I will be quick in asking them, I hope. I refer to the achievability of the targets. We are ambitious to achieve them but what I have heard from the range of speakers in recent days is that engagement and bringing people with us are very important, as are planning and execution. What is the view of each of the groups on how the process of engagement has been? I ask them to bear in mind that members are in a privileged position, as are they, as representative groups before us today. I ask them to think of the people who have never been before the committee. How has the process been thus far? Do our guests think it could or should be improved to include broader society?  My second question relates to the opportunity in this transition for the people our guests represent, whether they are workers, farmers, people living in poverty or those in business.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-18 11:00:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank all the witnesses. I have a number of questions. The officials from the Department of Transport mentioned research in the context of the focus on achievability of targets. As part of that research, are they looking at why, when cost is not a barrier to access to electric vehicles, EVs, there is not a greater uptake? I noted the figures from last year. Many people are still opting for SUVs, in particular, and other vehicles, when EVs would be an option.  We have heard significant criticism of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recent days regarding the level of preparedness and the alternatives being provided for farming communities and farmers in respect of alternative, sustainable models. Do the officials believe that criticism is fair? Much of it is levelled at their Department. What measures will they take to address that, if they do? I noticed many caveats in their contribution. What emissions reductions do they envisage for the agricultural sector in the term of the first carbon budget? The CCAC was critical of what it saw as a lack of an overarching, whole-of-government approach to climate action. How does the Department of the Taoiseach intend to address that and the significant implementation deficit?  Do the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Environment, Climate and Communications see an opportunity, in terms of increased participation, for the sustainable energy communities to have an improved and enhanced role and, as we heard from previous contributors, for the public participation networks to increase community-led climate action and bring about a understanding of and connection with these issues? How do they intend to co-ordinate and deliver that, if they believe such an opportunity exists?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-01-18 11:00:00+00:00	Carbon Budgets: Discussion (Resumed)	2	That is what Mr. Callanan envisages happening.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-08 10:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenges: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank Mr. Coyle for his presentation. I have a couple of quick questions. Sinn Féin tabled an Opposition Private Members' Bill that talked about the opportunity of offshore wind and the need for an industrial development authority for the sea. In Mr. Coyle's experience, is it more a case that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland have the capacity but it is about refocusing , repurposing or redirecting them? Do we need a new agency? Do we already have the agencies to deliver this? Is it about directing them?  My second question is on the focus and co-ordination and the issue of capacity. In Mr. Coyle's experience of the agencies he has dealt with but also in terms of the Civil Service and Departments, is the capacity there at this stage? Is there a shortfall in that regard? Co-ordination came up at our previous hearing on Thursday in response to a question from the Chairman. I heard the Tánaiste in the Dáil reference a cross-government task force on offshore wind. Is Mr. Coyle aware of that? How would he like to see it take shape? Should it just be for offshore wind or should it be expanded, and who should be involved?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-08 10:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenges: Discussion (Resumed)	2	My questions are for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. The cost of renewables came up in our earlier session in terms of the delivery task force for offshore wind. Will that have a cost dimension? We are an outlier in terms of the cost of renewables. Are auctions and the potential of further auctions to deliver further high-cost electricity within the Department's mandate or area of focus? What is it doing about that?  Grid capacity is related to cost. EirGrid has outlined a schedule of works or areas of the grid that will be rated up or upgraded. However, it has given no indication of timelines or when those works will be completed. Will all of them be delivered? It could be June, July or August of 2029. Has EirGrid given the Department an indicative timeline for those projects in the shaping our energy future report? If it has, will the Department officials share that with the committee?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-08 10:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenges: Discussion (Resumed)	3	I have a clear question about Shaping Our Electricity Future. There is a list of 48 grid reinforcement projects. Has EirGrid given the Department a timeline for when they will be completed with dates and, if so, can Mr. Finucane share them with us?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-08 10:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenges: Discussion (Resumed)	4	Mr. Finucane pointed towards the auction as a mechanism for driving down costs. Is the Department taking additional measures? Is it concerned about Ireland being an outlier in terms of the cost of renewables and are there specific initiatives it is taking to address that?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-22 11:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenge: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank Mr. Keating for his presentation. I will ask two brief questions, the first of which is on ports policy. When I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport before Christmas, she spoke about a multi-port approach and different things being done at different ports depending on the environment. Are we in the right place with that policy? I have heard some people argue that we should designate ports and move ahead with identified ports. What is Mr. Keating's sense of national ports policy and the development of the Shannon Foynes Port?  The Shannon Foynes Port Company has identified a future role in the marshalling, operations and maintenance of offshore wind farms. Did this come on the back of some consideration by the company? Did it rule out other elements of the industry? Why did it land on this role instead of manufacturing or the like?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-22 11:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenge: Discussion (Resumed)	2	I thank all the witnesses. I ask for an assessment on the technologies in respect of storage. Could Ireland be leaders in promising technologies that are receiving less attention than others? How much consideration has been given to mineral intensity for batteries? The witnesses have indicated that there are areas where we are leading. Are they being sufficiently supported? What might a suitable forum for engagement be like? There is now a cross-Government group on offshore wind. Do we need something broader?  I have a question for EirGrid, one I raised at a pervious meeting with departmental officials. The Shaping our Electricity Future document contains 48 grid reinforcement projects but no timelines are associated with them. Has EirGrid defined timelines? For example, what is the timeline for the upgrade on the line between Castlebar and Cloone in Leitrim? Will EirGrid publish them, present them to the committee or make them publicly available?  It was reported over the weekend that the Great Island power plant would be closed for four months. Is there concern over that and what are the contingency plans?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-22 11:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenge: Discussion (Resumed)	3	I asked about what a forum for engagement might be like.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-22 11:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenge: Discussion (Resumed)	4	Does the Department have to take the lead initially?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-03-22 11:00:00+00:00	Energy - Ambition and Challenge: Discussion (Resumed)	5	I have questions for the IESA about the opportunity offered by technologies and where those technologies are at. What consideration is given to the mineral intensity of batteries, for example?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-10 11:05:00+01:00	New Retrofitting Plan and the Built Environment: Discussion (Resumed)	1	I thank the witnesses. I will be brief with my questions in order to give them some opportunity to answer. Will Mr. Hoyne expand on the importance of the HLI studies and the potential impact of that in our approach to the use of heat pumps and other technologies? He stated that further innovations are needed in order to attract people to work in construction. Has Mr. Hoyne some ideas on that, and specifically in the context of the sustainable built environment?  Will Dr. Daly reflect on Ireland's approach to the retrofitting scheme? Is there a gap or an opportunity there with our approach? We have a tiered number, or a menu, of options. Does Dr. Daly feel the need for a more tailored approach for the types of properties that she has identified in pre-1945 buildings or in a lot of one-off housing? Does she believe there is a need for a more nuanced approach? If so, would that require a different skill set? What might that look like? Do we have enough heritage officers or conservationists?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-10 11:05:00+01:00	New Retrofitting Plan and the Built Environment: Discussion (Resumed)	2	"I have a question on data gaps for Mr. Hoyne. An argument has been put forward, some of which will have been heard this morning, on the approach taken by the Government in terms of the efficiency of reaching the emissions reduction target and the question around what we are actually measuring, in addition to the piece on social justice and equity. In his contribution, Mr. Hoyne outlined the one-stop shop and provided some reassurance in terms of quality assurance. He indicated that a majority of works will go through that system. However, that is a demand-led system and there is a question around who will be in a position to avail of the supports and whether they are the people in most need. We can define what ""need"" means but there is certainly a question about the poorest people in the coldest homes, for example, and whether the system can be reoriented to immediately direct those and others here. Senator Higgins talked about a public-led approach initially. I know there are trade-offs in that and I do not want to put Mr. Hoyne in the position of making a value judgment on it. What data gaps exist if we want to reorient the system and direct it, in the first instance, to the poorest people in the coldest homes?"
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-10 11:05:00+01:00	New Retrofitting Plan and the Built Environment: Discussion (Resumed)	3	Is that the case? We seem to use a lot of proxy indicators, such as who is living in social housing and who is in receipt of fuel allowance, as indications of income. Neither of those is a function of the quality of the house the person lives in. He or she could be in social housing that is A-rated. I think of this in the context of the working poor living in rural Ireland. Do we have that level of granular detail?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-10 11:05:00+01:00	New Retrofitting Plan and the Built Environment: Discussion (Resumed)	4	That is helpful. I thank Mr. Hoyne.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	1	I do not mind at all. I thank the witnesses. I will pick up on some of those points. In terms of sustainable energy communities, the SEAI came stated that it has a target of 500 SECs by 2025 and that it has 655. Very often in this field, it is the exact opposite, which says to me, that communities are champing at the bit. They are eager in this regard.  I met with many SECs, which will reflect on the experience. Some of the issues that have arisen relate to, for example, getting to grips with finance. A number of local authorities are now supporting them in that regard. It is a question of getting into the doing phase and delivering. We will have an opportunity to come back with further questions. What do the witnesses see as the potential for the SECs in their experience of them thus far? It seems that there is spectacular potential in terms of identifying place-based solutions on an area-by-area basis, mapping out the areas of greatest need and the potential to address energy poverty. How do we enable and empower those communities to take the next step? From the SEAI's perspective, where are the challenges and hurdles that need to be addressed within the SEC system and what is the ultimate potential of it?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	2	I meant to say that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was invited to attend this meeting. Its representatives should be here today because that Department has a big responsibility in respect of these issues. My sense, from its response and apology, is that it does not fully understand its role or if it does, it is not responding adequately. I want to put that on the record. The departmental officials should be here as they have a major responsibility for this area.  Does Ms Buggie believe there is a structure in terms of delivery? From my experience of SECs, a lot of them are tied in with public participation networks and local government and there is a lien between SEAI structures and local authority structures. Does she think the current structure is fit for purpose or is there an opportunity to improve on it?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	3	Do they have to be of a certain scale to apply for RESS?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	4	This has all been very interesting. I have a couple of quick questions. When I speak to the SECs they are waiting for a new fund, the local energy action fund, LEAF, which will do the divil and all. Will the witnesses give an update on enabling and empowering the SECs and that competitive piece regarding delivery? Will they give an update on LEAF? Are there ongoing discussions? What will it look like? Will it serve any or all of those purposes?  Mr. Somers made a point about the restriction to 1% ring-fencing for the community RESS. Is that a recent development? I did not pick up on the exact point he made. Was that the initial restriction when the State made the case for an exemption? Will he touch on that point again? Is there scope to go beyond the 1% or is it the case that an alternative model might be more appropriate? I ask him to speak to that point regarding the successful projects now under RESS. Are they all coming through that process of SEC to engagement with SEAI to RESS? Is it a successful path? Ms Baker might have a perspective on that.  My final question is for the departmental officials. EnergyCloud is a group that has made representations, and presented in the audiovisual room here, a possible model to do a number of things, including making use of waste wind energy and engaging with local authority tenants on that piece around making use of digital technology and smart technology. There are many potential benefits to it, from a bottom-up perspective, in addition to reducing waste. Is it something the Department is actively engaged in, considering and pursuing?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	5	It is what Dr. Byrne is hoping and what is the reality.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	6	When can we expect a decision?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	7	I had a question on EnergyCloud.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	8	Does Mr. Deegan wish to comment on the EnergyCloud proposition, namely, the social enterprise of linking industry with an approved housing body to try to support people to get out of energy poverty? I am not sure if he is familiar with the proposition.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-05-24 11:00:00+01:00	Empowering Local Government and Local Communities to Climate Action: Discussion	9	The Department should explore that opportunity.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-02 14:20:00+01:00	Engagement with the EU Commissioner for Energy	1	I thank the Commissioner for her presentation. Regarding the gas package, directive and regulations, how would she respond to the charge that the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas, ENTSOG, has too much influence and input? Should there be explicit transparency obligations to ensure that measures are consistent with EU and national climate and energy obligations as part of a plan to start decommissioning and reducing the use of gas in the medium term by the latest?  There is a debate in Ireland on liquefied natural gas, LNG. We may be using it via the pipeline, but we do not have LNG infrastructure. There is commentary to the effect that we should move in line with the move at European level and have that infrastructure here. This is understandably of deep concern to the climate movement. What is the Commissioner's response to that debate, in particular the prospect of locking ourselves into infrastructure, technology and fossil fuels for decades? Our starting point is different than others' starting points.  A large and rapid move to renewables is required. I hope that everyone is moving in the same direction, but this puts challenges on the capacity to deliver turbines and solar panels at scale at European level. How do we prioritise in this regard at a time when we are pulling from these resources to deliver LNG here, there and everywhere?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-02 14:20:00+01:00	Engagement with the EU Commissioner for Energy	2	What about the lock-in with new fossil fuel infrastructure, especially LNG? I also have a question about scaling up across Europe towards renewables. How do we do that when there is such a limited supply to start off with?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-03 11:00:00+01:00	Youth Perspectives on Climate Challenges: Discussion with Foróige and Comhairle na nÓg	1	I thank the Chair and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for organising the meeting and particular thanks to the witnesses for being here. There are some who would suggest that young people do not have a valuable contribution to make in these and other matters and the speakers have collectively blown that out of the water. A number of themes were raised. I do not want to pick out individual contributions. It was really well coordinated and the breadth of contributions really touched on the wide range of issues. Of course, this is an all encompassing issue. On the issue of empowering young people and communities, the need for a bottom-up approach was highlighted as was the issue of just transition and equity and fairness being important in everything we do in climate action, and not just for the wealthy. Strong points were made on the rural-urban divide and not leaving anybody behind. That is an important message for Government and for legislators. I commend the witnesses on being here and they should continue with their activism, stay engaged, use their agency and power to influence others and hold us to account.  It is important to recognise, while many people are of like mind to them, there are others whose interests are not served by progressive climate action. We need to recognise that in the political space and develop approaches to deal with it.   One of the issues I would like to hear more on from contributors is the challenge to reduce the consumption of energy and materials. In recent years, there has been a huge demand for fabrics, natural materials, natural resources, or data, for example. Do the guests have a sense what the future might look like in terms of consumption? Do they see a way of reducing it?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-14 11:00:00+01:00	Biodiversity: Engagement with Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage	1	"I thank Dr. Lynn for her opening statement, much of which focused on future plans and developments. I will ask about the current state of affairs. We keep hearing one word, that is, ""implementation"", and we have heard at various stages about the resourcing of the NPWS. Is the NPWS adequately resourced given the impending extension of its mandate and the types of new and complex planning applications that will be submitted? Does Dr. Lynn envisage that its role will change in the time ahead?  On 2 June, this committee heard from the European Commissioner for Energy. There is a clear stated policy to fast-track planning for renewables projects and perhaps there is a rationale for doing so. Is Dr. Lynn concerned about that policy's potential implications for biodiversity? What needs to be done to ensure we get the best results possible?  I ask Dr. Lynn to reflect on the current state of our inland waterways and rivers. I know we will have targets in future. However, Ireland has been going completely in the wrong direction as I understand it. I ask Dr. Lynn to give her thoughts on how we might address that."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-06-14 11:00:00+01:00	Biodiversity: Engagement with Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage	2	It was about the waterways. I am particularly interested in the Boyne Estuary SPA and the Boyne and Blackwater SAC. They are beside me and there are controversial plans. I ask about the quality of our waterways, the current trends and what might be done to address them.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-08-30 12:00:00+01:00	Energy Supply and Security: Discussion	1	"I thank the witnesses. It is important that we are here and I welcome the opportunity for the debate. There is much concern and this points to a possible spectacular failure to manage our energy transition. People are deeply concerned. There is a Government that has been arguing against progressive market reforms at a European and Irish level and it is failing to deliver targeted supports. Its representatives are coming here today talking about a ""plan"" to address energy poverty, despite the fact the strategy is out of date since 2019. It is important we have the opportunity to address matters today.  My first question is to EirGrid and the CRU. Will they clarify that the buffer or head room we have for winter 2022 is 280 MW? On the demand side and on-site generation, are we saying there is capacity to do 200 MW over the winter? Will they confirm that position because this would provide the type of clarity that people want with regard to the prospect or risk of blackouts over winter?  The second question is for the CRU. Was the Government's introduction of the EirGrid and turf Bill a vote of no confidence in the CRU and the capacity remuneration mechanism? It essentially rewrites the rule book and says that the mechanisms of the CRU had delivered error after error in the winter of 2021 and the winter of 2022. We have heard the criticism from EirGrid.  The CRU mechanism will be responsible for delivering 1,300 MW between now and 2030. What confidence can anyone have that this will be right? What lessons have been learned? What were the failings that will now be addressed? The witnesses attended this committee in October 2021 and pointed towards statutory processes, ancillary infrastructure and economic signals. It seems, nearly 12 months on, that we are still in an iterative process of learning from mistakes. I ask the witnesses to please give us some assurance that they are in control."
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-08-30 12:00:00+01:00	Energy Supply and Security: Discussion	2	What would Mr. Doyle say it is now, of that 500 MW?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-08-30 12:00:00+01:00	Energy Supply and Security: Discussion	4	Ms MacEvilly mentioned energy on this island but my understanding is that it is a different experience in the North. What is different between North and South? What are the reasons she referred to?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-08-30 12:00:00+01:00	Energy Supply and Security: Discussion	5	One of the main points the witnesses have made is about planning and licensing. I have heard that from three contributors. I presume that is among a number of factors.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-08-30 12:00:00+01:00	Energy Supply and Security: Discussion	6	I will pick up on Deputy Whitmore's point on the plans. We need those, although I recognise the constraints in terms of the budgetary cycle, for security of supply, generation capacity and price. It is causing inordinate panic among communities and households. There is a constant feeling of impending doom surrounding further price hikes. The news cycle is full of this stuff. People are waiting for the next increase. Government has a job to do in terms of providing information for people. There are benefits in terms of a price cap, where there is clarity. The approach the Government is taking does not provide that but there is a huge need to adequately inform people. The Government should bring in the energy companies and hold them to a line as to what increases are coming and when. It should stop treating them with kid gloves.  On the retrofitting plan, it would be completely unforgivable as we start into September to miss targets by the end of the year, particularly for those people at risk of fuel poverty.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	1	Mr. Fenlon says he has been monitoring the hardship fund. Has demand increased over time? Does he think people are aware of the fund in the first instance and what is the pattern of demand? Electric Ireland stated €3 million has gone to 4,000 customers. That is roughly €750 per customer. Has demand increased as the price of energy has increased? The fund has been in place for a couple of years including during the Covid pandemic. Can I get a sense of the scale of demand and the timing of it?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	3	By the CRU's definition.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	4	I will interrupt Mr. Fenlon because I am managing my time. The €3 million needs to be increased and more people need to be made aware of the fund. Does Mr. Fenlon know what percentage of Electric Ireland's electricity supply is gas and non-gas generation?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	5	The witnesses do not know.  An issue that has come up repeatedly is dual pricing. Dual pricing in the insurance market has been criticised but essentially, Electric Ireland does that. New customers get a better tariff than existing customers. Has Electric Ireland considered, as has been widely called for by a range of agencies, putting every consumer on the lowest possible tariff? I presume it is making a profit on all tariffs or does it have a loss leader?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	6	If the CRU insisted that Electric Ireland offer the lowest tariff I presume it would have to act on that.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	7	How many pay-as-you-customers does Electric Ireland have?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	8	A disconnection moratorium applies to some customers, including vulnerable customers at the moment and customers more generally at the start of December. Can Electric Ireland give a commitment that it will not disconnect people over this winter? There has been a lot of focus on extreme hardship and on those pay-as-you-go customers. Can it give that commitment and what will it look like? How will it be done?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	9	Disconnections have increased this year.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	10	712 for half a year.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	11	More than half then were Electric Ireland customers.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	12	And more than half of the disconnections.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	13	I thank the witnesses. I will focus on the cost of connections and the speed and flexibility of the organisation in facilitating connection requests. We have heard from a number of representative groups and community groups that the cost is very expensive by international comparison and prohibitively expensive in some cases for community groups that might be considering projects around renewables. I note what is in the opening statement but what would the witnesses say in response to that charge?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-04 11:15:00+01:00	Energy Prices: Discussion	14	I will interrupt there because I am conscious of time. The other issue we hear from industry is around work practices within the organisation that restrict the time of day or year when connections can happen. Is it to do with when the clocks go forward and back? Is it during that period? Can the witnesses speak to that charge? It seems very strange to me. For example, one cannot get work done before 9 o'clock in the morning or in the winter months. Are these long-standing practices appropriate at this time?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	1	I have a number of questions and I will try to get through them as quickly as I can. On the warmer homes scheme, the target is 4,800 and Dr. Byrne said 3,200 homes had been done up to the end of September. How many of those are to B2 or B2 equivalent? I will ask Mr. Randles, our head of delivery, to address that question.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	2	That is 231 out of 3,200. Why is the number so low in that group?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	3	Does Mr. Randles expect to hit the 4,800 figure at the end of December?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	4	In regard to the overall target, the Minister said at the end of August that the overall target is 27,800 for this year. Is that correct?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	5	At the end of August, there were 13,400. How many have been done up to the end of September?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	6	How many of those are B2 or B2 equivalent? Some 4,200 is the figure the Minister gave at the end of August.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	7	How are the one-stop shops performing or delivering at this stage? I know there is high demand but are they delivering retrofits?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	8	On what scale?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	9	The level of inflation is a concern. What rate of inflation is currently being reported in this sector? Do the witnesses consider it to be a deterrent? I know people for whom it is a deterrent. They engaged but the cost of the work was beyond their expectation and their means. What level of inflation is being reported on these works?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	10	I thank Dr. Byrne. On the most recent occasion the witnesses appeared before the committee, they were conducting a study on whether heat pumps can be installed in homes with lower BERs. Has that study concluded or is it near conclusion?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	11	I have a number of quick questions for our guests. We are aiming for 6,600 solar roof installations by the end of the year and 7,500 retrofits to a rating of B2. Do we know how many of the 7,500 retrofits to B2 standard will be achieved by the installation of solar panels alone? How many of the retrofits to a B2 standard were, or will be, achieved by solar panels alone?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	12	Does anyone have that figure?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	13	I thank Mr. Randles. I have been contacted by people who are engaging with the better energy communities scheme, particularly for businesses that want to use solar energy to reduce their energy bills. There are questions about what they see as shifting goalposts in respect of the guidelines that are coming in. Are the witnesses aware of that issue? Has it been resolved? Has there been a good uptake on the scheme for businesses and others this year?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	14	Okay.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	15	I thank Mr. O'Mahony. I have his point.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	16	I am tight for time but I have Mr. O'Mahony's point. What is the total number of households in the private rental sector that have availed of SEAI retrofit grants this year? I expect that there are particular challenges for the private rented sector. What is that figure? Are there plans to improve on it?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	17	I see that as a problem in and of itself. Since the introduction of these schemes, one of the concerns has been that renters will be left behind. Dr. Byrne mentioned earlier that SEAI has every level of detail. That is fundamental information that would need to be captured in applications.  I see a number of themes in the questions asked by both the Government and the Opposition. Some of them are fundamental. Mr. O'Mahony said we have to do it all and pointed to an area-led approach on the community energy grant schemes. We see commercial decisions moving to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is not surprising, given the incentives and plans involved, but there have been a paltry number of deep retrofits or retrofits to a B2 standard in 2022. We have sectoral emissions ceilings reports which state we need to be delivering in excess of 60,000 retrofits a year from 2022. We will deliver 7,500 this year. It strikes me that there is a plan that will deliver B2 homes in new-builds, in the homes of people who can afford it and in already warm homes that get solar panels. At the same time, people living in poverty, energy poverty and colder homes are being left behind on long lists. There is the low-hanging fruit of shallow retrofits and technologies. The change is not happening at the pace and scale we need it to, particularly at a time of energy crisis. What do our guests have to say to that charge? It has been said on both sides.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	18	The question is about the targeting of the resource and delivering efficiently and effectively. The point has been repeatedly made about the low-hanging fruit of shallow retrofits. All the incentives are to move into deeper retrofits that are incredibly slow.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	19	I have a number of quick questions. The case has been made on delivery, picking up on a number of points already made, that if we got the plan-led approach in district heating on residential and commercial planning, that we could deliver homes more cheaply and more quickly. Industry has said that if it took that approach with district heating, homes could be delivered more cheaply, and 14 days more quickly. Is that something the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI has heard of, concurs with or is familiar with?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	20	This will also be in respect of delivering new homes and local area plans. If we employed district heating for the new homes to be built, they could then be delivered more cost effectively and in a quicker timeframe because one is then taking a plan-led approach as opposed to repeated individual connections.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	21	Returning again to that point of low-hanging fruit and achieving quick results, I am minded that both the Climate Change Advisory Council and others such as Friends of the Earth have said that at this point in time, we need to get attic and wall insulation, in particular, delivered at scale for this winter. They talked about the need to provide not 80% but 100% grants. Is that a case that the SEAI has heard from them and is it something that SEAI is considering or has considered? If it has considered it, what conclusions has it come to?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	22	SEAI has heard from them then.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	23	I thank Mr. O’Mahony for that answer. My final question is on the emissions reductions savings. That is what this is all about, as has been articulated by SEAI. Of the retrofits that have been carried out this year, particularly the ones to B2 level, has the SEAI an assessment of the emissions reductions savings that have been made on those? I believe that there will be 3,200 such homes in the warmer homes schemes, and I appreciate that they are not all B2 level homes. Does the SEAI have emissions reduction savings per scheme?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	24	That would be helpful. On that point and in returning to earlier points, I note that there is not a scheme directly targeted at homes with solid fuel. Should there be one? We have had a conversation on turf and on the sector emission ceilings which specifically say that there should be a targeting of that cohort of people. Has the SEAI considered the quickest way to get the maximum amount of CO2 emissions reductions?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-11 11:10:00+01:00	Retrofitting Schemes: Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland	25	I thank Dr. Byrne and the Chairman.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-31 11:00:00+00:00	Engagement with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities	1	I thank the witnesses for appearing today. I wish to make a point about the large energy user subsidy. We need much more detail on that. We are in an incredible situation. I welcome the discussion on the extension of the moratorium. There is always a loaded argument on moral hazard and how certain types of people will act in a certain way if they are given the comfort of a moratorium in the middle of a crisis. I do not believe that is borne out in the evidence before us here. When people have money to pay their bills, they pay their bills.  I want to focus on security of supply and our capacity going into winter 2023. There are some points in the additional information relating to temporary emergency generation and the progress made in that regard. Under point 5, there is a reference to capacity market auctions for later this year and the years ahead. What is the generational capacity picture for this year? What is new and coming on stream and when will it be delivered? Various media reports have indicated there is a question mark over some of those projects regarding the financial viability committed to some years ago. Will our guests set out where those projects are and how confident they are as to whether they will be delivered?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-31 11:00:00+00:00	Engagement with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities	2	This calendar year, what capacity does CRU hope to deliver in that T-1 auction for July to be delivered in October? Is Mr. Melvin satisfied it will be delivered and that there will be capacity in the system for winter 2023-24?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-31 11:00:00+00:00	Engagement with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities	3	I have a couple of questions. On the negative PSO levy, when will people see the benefit? Are they already doing so? What is the position on the measures relating to windfall taxes and the two versions of those? Has there been an assessment of the impact they will have on domestic bills? When will domestic customers see the impact?  The question on windfall taxes relates to the inframarginal rent cap. We had some information on it this morning. Mr. Melvin might comment on it.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-31 11:00:00+00:00	Engagement with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities	4	The last time the representatives were in, they had a rough estimate.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2023-01-31 11:00:00+00:00	Engagement with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities	5	That is fine. The representatives have touched on some aspects of the last subject I wanted to touch on, namely, batteries and the availability to the system of backup capacity from large energy users and others. On one of the previous occasions on which representatives of EirGrid were before us with representatives of the CRU, they pointed to what I would regard as some challenges within the system. They stated that, in terms of demand-side management, we have approximately 500 MW but that the challenge is ensuring the closure of the gap between what is signed up to and what is delivered. The committee received a letter from the sector in this regard. I subsequently heard from stakeholders that they see insufficient capacity, pointing to relatively low availability and reliability of capacity. They say there should be penalties for poor availability and that measures should be taken within the market rules. They also refer to the grid code that could improve the availability of capacity. Does the commission agree and is it working on it? Does it believe there is potential in this regard? Battery capacity will be a key pillar in the time ahead, particularly as we move towards-----

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-14 13:30:00+01:00	Issues Impacting the Taxi Industry: Discussion	2	"Yes. It is important to have the opportunity to air the issues. It is very clear from the contributions we have heard that there are fundamental problems with the voice of taxi drivers being heard in the industry and being central to the development of the industry. That is something that has been repeated and it will be central to a lot of what we raise with the NTA and on which we need to see reform in the time ahead. I encourage the witnesses to develop their own thinking and proposals on what an alternative to the TAC would look like. In the context of a number of comments, a long-standing proposal is included in the programme for Government for a public transport forum. Is that something that the witnesses would like to see and what might that look like?  The bigger issue I want to raise relates to the viability of the sector. I see an incredible contradiction within the system relating to the EV grants. On the one hand, the Government is saying that it wants a green transition, it wants the taxi industry to go green and it is putting €15 million per year into this. Problems have been identified with that, as outlined by the witnesses. At the same time, there will be a cliff edge in 2023 whereby thousands of vehicles are going to be hit by the nine-year rule and, as a consequence, individual drivers will be left to decide whether to get another petrol or diesel vehicle to tide them over in the meantime or to exit the industry all together. That scenario has been spelled out to the NTA and the Minister by myself and others. We have outlined that scenario to them and what they say in response is, ""Don't panic"". They say they are looking at it, a fare increase was introduced recently, a recruitment campaign is ongoing and that will solve the problem. That is what the NTA will say to us again next week and I want to ask our guests, as industry representatives, what they say to that."

Can the witnesses tell me in clear terms that there will not be an additional supply coming in through the NTA's recruitment campaign or from anywhere else to make up that difference?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-09-14 13:30:00+01:00	Issues Impacting the Taxi Industry: Discussion	5	I want to pick up on those points on the extension of the ten-year rule, the issue of transferability, and the bureaucracy involved in the suitability tests, which we are hearing loud and clear. There is also the big piece around the voice of taxi drivers for the future of their own industry. These are the issues we are hearing loud and clear today and we will have to pick up on these points with the NTA and come back with something for the drivers and I thank them for their time.

I apologise for missing the opening statements. I was at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action that clashes with this meeting. My question is directed at the witnesses from Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead. How many drivers do Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland employ? What is the shortage of drivers in delivering the services to which they are contracted? Will they speak to the issues of absenteeism, or whatever the term is with regard to Covid or other reasons, and turnover of staff? I ask Dublin Bus to answer first.

I thank the Minister for the update and the figures he provided. To follow on from the points made by Deputy Whitmore and in terms of the targeting of the retrofit plan to areas of most need, will the warmer homes scheme be the vehicle for that or does the Minister intend to identify areas of deprivation or need through mapping or other means to ensure the welcome resources are targeted at where they are needed?  On the issue of solar photovoltaic, PV, targets, concerns have been raised regarding hold-ups in the system. It has been reported by people working on the front line in this area that projects that requested their second stage payment in August 2020 have not yet received an invoice, eight months later. That stalls things and means they cannot move to design stage. Similarly, I believe none of those involved in the renewable electricity support scheme 1, RESS 1, auction, have yet seen a work programme. I ask the Minister to address that issue.  Finally, I ask the Minister to outline the status of the North-South interconnector and the proposed review of the project. I heard there is a scoping review for a short review. Has that been agreed? What is the timeline in that regard? Has it been resourced?

Do they apply to all existing licences or tentative ones? At what stage of the licensing process will licences be caught by these provisions or excluded?  We have discussed energy security in the Dáil Chamber in terms of ensuring that we do not have blackouts. The Sunday newspapers wrote much about the concerns in that regard at the weekend. This brings me to the issue of assessment. We have an energy review. It is important that we see that information so that there can be confidence in the security of our energy supply for the years ahead and that we are not facing a cliff edge, as some call it.  Sinn Féin proposed amendments to deal with future situations where this legislation, including the Minister's amendment, might be contested. They related to dispute settlement and the likes of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. That they were ruled out of order was disappointing.  We did not get to discuss amendment No. 1, but a point that will run through this debate is people having confidence that we are making decisions based on sound and up-to-date information that is made publicly available and to which communities and different sectors can contribute. This is an important matter that relates to this amendment and will arise time and again during our discussions on this legislation.

There are important principles in terms of fairness, equity, differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities that need to be explicitly outlined in the Bill.

However, the discussion thus far is not encouraging. We have all gone to the bother of spending time putting amendments together to try to improve the Bill. There is a huge amount of overlap in wording, in some instances, and certainly in the spirit of what is being proposed in the various amendments. Many of them have been ruled out of order and that is an issue.  I support this amendment and the other amendments coming forward that look and sound like it. They are all trying to do the same type of thing, which is to make the legislation more explicit in terms of targets and accountability for those targets, and ensuring the process of getting to those targets is fair and equitable and that the voice of communities and sectoral representatives are heard. We need to see more from the Minister in this regard or we will have a problem with the Bill every step of the way.

The Bill is not strong enough and needs to be improved. I do not care whether the amendments come from the Opposition or the Minister. This process needs to be about taking the Bill back to the Minister's colleagues and partners in government, the Attorney General or whoever, and saying he is hearing, loud and clear, that we need to improve on this Bill. It was improved in the previous pre-legislative, PLS, stage and can be improved on again.  My concern is that the Minister sounds deaf to the deep concerns being expressed by communities throughout the country, which he surely heard loud and clear during the debate on Second Stage. There are deep concerns the Bill does not provide protections for our most vulnerable and those who will be worst affected by these climate measures. The Bill does not go nearly far enough in terms of definitions, commitments and the principles of just transition. They want, we want and I certainly want more explicit detail on this and commitments from the Government spelled out in legislation. This would serve two purposes. It would strengthen the Bill and provide protection for communities. It would also allay the fears of the detractors of the Bill. People are playing political games with this stuff. It is a significant problem for the climate movement generally if we are saying that there is no room for manoeuvre outside of what the Minister is putting forward. The Minister needs to leave the door open. He needs to hear what is being said on Committee Stage and come back with amendments based on what he hears. This needs to be a very important part of what we are doing.

I take on board what Deputy Naughten has said about this matter. Deputy Naughten spoke about the issue of split targets and putting some meat on the idea of distinct characteristics of biogenic methane as provided for in the Bill. When I read this amendment and its related amendments, it looked as though biogenic methane would not be considered in the national objective or the Bill's provisions. One of our recommendations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and in our report - I believe it was recommendation No. 36 - was that consideration would have to be given and meat would have to be put on the bone, for want of a better term, of what is meant by ""distinct characteristics of biogenic methane"" and the role of agriculture in society and what its implications would be for accounting and other requirements.  I have a question about this group of amendments, but I would also like to hear from the Minister about the prospect of split targets. Have they been considered? They are employed elsewhere. A reply would inform the committee."

Amendments Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, seek to improve on the definition of climate justice contained in the Bill and they all do so. Sinn Féin is proposing amendment No. 14, which seeks to address what we would see as the weaknesses within the current definition of climate justice in the flexibility it allows. The Bill leaves the option to come up short and our amendment seeks to strengthen the language in the Bill on equity and fairness. The definition we are proposing is based on the Mary Robinson Foundation definition. I know it is a definition the Minister has supported and used in the past. It is one of the most important opportunities to build and improve on this legislation. I would call on the Minister to support, if not the Sinn Féin amendment, one of the other amendments, or to come back with a stronger definition, if not now then on Report Stage.

This is one of the most important points we will speak about on Committee Stage. It is fundamental to the principle and spirit of our climate ambition. If the Bill does two things, they are to set interim and long-term targets and to set out a plan. People need to see that their voices will be heard within it, that they will be considered and brought along, that this will not be just a case of more of the same, and that this will not confirm and firm up these positions. The Minister can put whatever terms on them he wants. We can call it the haves versus the have-nots, or those advantaged versus those disadvantaged.  A number of previous speakers have spoken on other amendments. There is a real fear in communities about what the implications of climate action and the response to climate action mean. We need to accept and acknowledge this as real and earnest. Some of it is based on practical experience with regard to people struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills. They are falling deeper and deeper into this scenario with the prospect, as they see it, of more of the same and worse to come. The Bill needs to spell out that the Government and future governments have their backs. It needs to spell it out in black and white because it is not there and there is deep concern about it. There is an opportunity to improve on it and this is a way to do so. If we do not do it, reasonable questions will be asked as to why not, legitimate concerns will not be allayed, and it will be a seriously missed opportunity.

I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 23 because half of it is contained in the amendment before it, but with leave to reintroduce it at Report Stage.

This amendment is self-explanatory. It is a definition of socioeconomic disadvantage. Following on from our earlier discussions on the need for the Bill to be explicit in ensuring fairness and equity, there is a need for a definition of what disadvantage and socioeconomic disadvantage means, and the elements of it in terms of poverty, source of income, illiteracy, level of education, employment status or being a member of a disadvantaged group. This amendment would add to the Bill and strengthen it by ensuring the Government is in a position to ensure that climate action is delivered in a fair way.

Regarding the Minister of State's amendment No. 107, a number of alternative formulas of words were put forward and, I think, ruled out of order. I am not sure whether this has been considered or whether the Minister of State has a perspective on it. I think the formula the Minister of State has come up with is a first-year-versus-last-year, 2018-versus-2030 one, with no reference to the 7% year on year referred to in the programme for Government. Was that considered?  I have an open question about the reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane. The discussion on that is welcome and important. What does it mean in real terms? Are the tools to be developed? Is there a commitment on the part of the Government to develop those tools to make assessments separately? What formulas will be used? There is, I presume, deliberate reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane. What does that mean in practical terms? What can the Minister of State say to concerned people looking on today?

I asked what the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane mean. Will tools be developed to account for that? In practical terms, what does that mean and what will it mean?

We want to rule out the option of coming back with an unrevised budget. It would be a significant issue if the Houses of the Oireachtas were to reject a budget and that should mean something in what the budget contains. Those two amendments which form part of this group of our amendments seek to address those issues.

It is really important that the Minister of State hears the concerns being outlined here. This legislation does two big things. It sets ambitious interim targets and 2050 targets and sets out a framework for making a plan to achieve those targets. For me, the framework is about whose voices are heard, who has a place at the table and the level of transparency and accountability. The Minister of State's input will not provide assurance to people who are looking on and are concerned about their input into this process through their public representatives and outside of that. That in itself will raise further concerns in respect of those people who for whatever motivation want to undermine the climate effort. The Minister of State should look at the piece relating to just transition. We had that argument yesterday and may have it again but this piece relating to democratic accountability is important because we are talking about a situation that is unlikely to arise in the first instance no more than in the case of the annual budget in October because we have parties and the Whip system. This is all the more reason to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas a say in this rather than just the Government. I made the point in terms of coming back with unrevised proposals or, as Deputy Naughten said, proposals that are completely revised to the extent that they look nothing like the first revision in any way. It is an issue that needs to be heard and addressed here between now and Report Stage.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2021-06-09 09:30:00+01:00	Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Committee Stage (Resumed)	11	I wish to return to the suggestion that it is an either-or situation. I echo the point that we have to follow the science. There are already huge provisions in the Bill that acknowledge the range of perspectives and voices that have to be heard. This is built into it. What is very important is the process by which we come to agree the budgets and various elements of the plan, whose voices are heard and how we make these decisions. What we are speaking about here is how we agree the budgets, the strategies and the role of the Oireachtas with regard to it. After this, it is entirely appropriate that there is leave to use the courts to ensure these roads are being followed and the plans are being implemented. I do not accept that we should write the Oireachtas out of this piece in terms of its role for oversight, scrutiny and approval. The Government's approach is completely unnecessary because there will be very limited circumstances and the situation might never arise. I do not believe it should be there in the first place.

(b) Where a vacancy arises, or is anticipated will arise, on the Advisory Council, the Government shall, for the purposes of identifying persons and making recommendations to the Government in respect of those persons for appointment as members of the Advisory Council, invite the Public Appointments Service to undertake a selection competition.  (c) The Public Appointments Service shall, subject toparagraph(d), appoint a selection panel.  (d) Of the members of the selection panel, one of them shall be nominated by the Director of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  (e) The Public Appointments Service shall appoint the members of the selection panel from amongst persons who, in the opinion of the Public Appointments Service, have relevant experience of,and expertise in relation to, matters outlined in section 9(c)(4)(a) of the Principal Act.  (f) The Minister shall agree with the Public Appointments Service the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy on the Advisory Council.  (g) A vacancy on the Advisory Council shall be advertised publicly and shall include details of the agreed selection criteria for the filling of the vacancy and the process to be implemented in respect of the filling of that vacancy.  (h) The Public Appointments Service may adopt such procedures as it thinks fit to carry out its functions under this section. (i) A person shall not be recommended for appointment by the President under this section unless the person is, in the opinion of the Public Appointments Service and the Government agrees, suitably qualified for such appointment by reason of their possessing such relevant experience, training or expertise as is appropriate having regardin particular tothe functions conferred on the Advisory Council by or under this Act.  (j) The Public Appointments Service shall provide the Government with particulars of experience, training and expertise of the person whom it recommends under this section.  (k) Where the Public Appointments Service makes a recommendation for the appointment of a person to the Advisory Council, the Government shall accept that recommendation.  (l) In exceptional circumstances, where the Government, for substantial and stated reasons, is unable to accept the recommendation by the Public Appointments Service of a particular person, it shall inform the Public Appointments Service of that fact and the reasons for it and shall request the Public Appointments Service to make another recommendation in respect of the vacancy and, the Public Appointments Service shall—  (i) consider the Government’s reasons, and  (ii) unless the Public Appointments Service disagrees with the reasons and wishes to make representations to the Government in that behalf, make another recommendation for appointment to the Advisory Council.  (m) In making recommendations for appointment of persons to the Advisory Council under this section, the Public Appointments Service, and the Government shall have regard to the need to ensure that the members of the Advisory Council broadly reflect the nature of Irish society and that such persons possess knowledge of, or experience in—  (i) mattersoutlined in subsection (4)(a)(as amended), and  (ii) without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a),matters connected with persons or classes of persons who are disadvantaged by reference to the following factors:  (I) gender;  (II) civilstatus;  (III) familystatus;  (IV) sexualorientation;  (V) religiousbelief; (VI) age;  (VII) disability;  (VIII) race, includingcolour, nationality, ethnic or nationalorigin;  (IX) membership of the Traveller community;  (X) socio-economic disadvantage.  (n) The factors specified in clauses (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VII) and (IX) of paragraph (m)(ii) have the same meanings they have in section 2 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.”  This amendment is quite self-explanatory. I am sure the Minister of State has had sight of it. From our perspective, it is trying to fill out, and make more complete and comprehensive, the process for appointments. The framing and wording are adapted from that used for appointments to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. We believe it would be an enhancement on the process that already applies.   I also raise a query with the Minister of State. I am conscious that concerns have been raised by the CCAC about some aspects of the Bill. The Department briefed the CCAC. The CCAC has looked for legal advice in recent days. It would be helpful for us to know what that advice related to. Was it related to the appointments process or the tools for measuring emissions? I would like to hear from the Minister of State about that.

At pre-legislative scrutiny stage, we heard from witnesses about the role, and prospective role, of the CCAC. It would be helpful for us to know what its concerns were so we can factor them into our considerations at this stage.

Maybe he will give it some consideration between now and Report Stage.

We discussed this earlier. I am not entirely clear on the criteria by which amendments have been excluded. I know that the committee will follow up in that regard and I have done the same myself. This amendment seeks a financial, social, economic and rural impact assessment. We have looked for one elsewhere and those types of amendments have been ruled out for a range of reasons. This is an important opportunity to carry out such assessments to consider the potential impact of this for a range of reasons. We have had this discussion already. We seek adequate involvement and engagement from communities such that there is transparency surrounding decision-making. Nobody for a second is suggesting that anyone will be afforded the opportunity to avoid responsibility, but it is fair to say there are those who would point to what they see as contradictions within decisions that have been made about our response to climate change, whether in one sector or another. I mention as an example the importation of peat from the Balkans or Germany at a time when restrictions are in place here. We must be sure there is an adequate economic, social, financial and rural impact assessment of these decisions.

(f) Notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 11, in fulfilling obligations under those paragraphs, any recommendation to the effect of a reduction in a food production activity must be made on the basis of sustainability as it pertains to individual aspects of that food production activity and with due regard to the social, economic and rural impact of such a reduction. (g) Notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 11, any recommendation pertaining to livestock numbers must be accompanied by a sustainability, social, economic, and rural impact assessment outlining the effects of such a recommendation on a local and regional basis.”,”. I will let Deputy Carthy, who is joining us now, speak to amendment No. 194.

There is a consistency through the Sinn Féin amendments. There is a very clear theme not just in our own amendments, but in the various amendments that have been submitted by the full range of opposition parties and groups, in fairness to everybody who went to the bother of scrutinising the Bill and looking at where they felt there was room for improvement in relation to it. Key to those themes are the level of accountability, the democratic nature of the way decisions are made, who has a voice at the table and whose voice is heard and not heard. The amendments also seek to ensure and to make explicit in the Bill the values that will be upheld as we embark upon this journey towards net zero, including fairness in respect of burden sharing and equality.  I have argued - this amendment also speaks to the point - that there is an ethical, moral and environmental rationale for making such things explicit. I also believe there is a political rationale, because it speaks to the very real concerns communities right across the country have, based on experience to date and many of the arguments that have been made in the past number of days and will be made in the next few hours in relation to the prospect of what we are setting ourselves up for here and the real risk that by the nature of the potential for emission reductions in certain sectors compared to others, there will be unfair burden sharing.  I echo Deputy Carthy's point. I put it to the Minister of State that given everything he has heard on this amendment and throughout the meeting today, along with the Minister, when he was present, it is clear this Bill is not the finished article. It needs to come back improved on Report Stage.

Thank you Chair for your stewardship. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their engagement. The level of engagement and the large number of amendments submitted by the Opposition is a reflection of how serious we all take this issue. That was true of the committee on pre-legislative scrutiny stage also. I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the number of days of engagement and the debate and discussion we have had. All of us can count to nine or ten on a given day and we know the numbers in terms of the Government and the Opposition, but the amendments coming from the Opposition are being tabled for a reason, which is that there is room for improvement and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that before the Report Stage debate on the Bill on which we will also fully engage.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	67	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-02-08 12:10:00+00:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications (Revised)	2	I will throw out some questions on subhead A1. Some of this may be related to the different way of presenting figures this year. As I see it, there is a reduction in administration pay. Does that relate to a staff reduction? Why are we seeing that? On A3, for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, we see a change in current versus capital expenditure. Under the capital programme, was there a specific building project last year versus what is projected for the year ahead? Under A8, the just transition fund, there is €11 million versus €34 million. The reference is to the EU and Ireland. Is this all Exchequer funding or will we earmark funds that will come through the EU just transition fund? If that is the case, how is that divided? Up to €86.5 million is identified for the EU piece. When will we see that? Do we expect to see it? How will it be spent?  How is the climate action fund referred to in subhead A10 budgeted for in the Revised Estimate? I do not see a figure there. Will there be an impact on the climate action fund on the basis of the biofuels obligation offset?

There is a difference in the capital. Were there specific capital works? I presume the current figure relates to pay and increased staffing levels. What is the reduction in capital expenditure?

When will the export tariff scheme be in place and operational? On the same subhead, the targets for retrofits were 21,544 in 2021 and 19,400 in 2022. I ask the Minister of State to speak to that, please.  On outputs, the target for the number of lower income households provided with energy efficiency upgrades is lower for this year than last. In 2021, the target was 5,800 and in 2022 it is 4,500. I know there is a note on that but I ask the Minister of State to speak on it. It states that the number of homes is lower than target for the previous year but this is because of a shift to deeper energy efficiency measures resulting in more energy and carbon dioxide savings. I raise that in the context of the national retrofitting plan that we will hopefully see later today. Sinn Féin specifically asked questions around the options to achieve reductions in emissions. For example, what is the difference between 20,000 houses moving to a BER C2 versus 20,000 houses moving to a BER B2? Is a different approach by the Department planned for in these figures? The headline figure is still to have 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps installed. Is it planned to do this in a different way and, if so, are there cost implications from that?  Are there targets for the expansion of the sustainable energy community, SEC, programme? I know there are targets for 2030. How do they relate to 2022? What kind of expansion do we hope or expect to see? From meeting members of some of the sustainable energy communities, I know there was talk of a new funding model or type of grant or fund where sustainable energy communities would be rewarded for good progress and the amount of retrofits done in a community. They referred to it as a LEAF or local energy assessment fund. I do not know if that rings a bell with the Minister of State. What are the plans with that?  The €100 electricity rebate is coming from departmental energy efficiency funding and broadband funds. From where exactly is that money coming? What implications will that have for the roll-out of the affected schemes? I am particularly interested in how those on long waiting lists for retrofitting works will be prioritised in year one.

A pensioner who had cavity wall insulation done ten years ago cannot go back to the SEAI now for a grant for attic insulation because of the one-visit rule. Will that rule be removed? Will such persons be able to avail of a further grant for, say, attic insulation?

A number of other amendments share the theme and seek to insert the principles of just transition throughout the Bill, which is really important.  My amendment No. 13 seeks to confer responsibility such that ""the circular economy strategy shall"" rather than the ""circular economy strategy may"" and that this is done ""Within 6 months"". This is an issue that arose during the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS. Amendment No. 13 seeks to tighten the timeline.  As for amendment No. 19, because various witnesses raised the need do so do during pre-legislative scrutiny, amendment No. 19 seeks to insert a provision on ""how to achieve greater harmonisation of civic amenity site services in terms of opening hours, materials accepted, accessibility, tariffs charged and an examination of the co-location of these facilities with co-operative and social enterprises"". An important feature of this legislation is that it needs to be embraced by communities and people need to realise a step change in the way that we do things and my amendment highlights one such way to do that."

Our suggestion is to include a reference on page 7, line 21, to every stage of the supply chain being adapted. It strengthens the definition to explicitly state it is at ""every stage"". In that way, it better reflects the necessary scope of the circular economy."

The Minister of State said that amendment No. 14 is a stronger amendment on the basis that it does not include the words, “Within 6 months”.

This would essentially provide an update on what progress is being made. This may have come up at pre-legislative scrutiny. There would be a certain harmony if this report were to coincide with, for example, the annual climate action plan. In this amendment, we call for a progress report to be prepared.   Amendment No. 23, similar to the strategy that is already in the plan, proposes that a progress report would be published and would be made available on the website.

(3) The report shall also examine whether a Scoring System on Repairability as part of the existing energy label for all energy-consuming products, can be introduced, to inform consumers of the repairability of a product at the point of purchase.”. On the right to repair, this amendment seeks that the Minister would, within 12 months, prepare and publish a report examining how a right to repair can be introduced in Ireland. We had significant discussions at pre-legislative scrutiny, and there are recommendations in our report. It is a weakness of the Bill that it does not adequately address this. Some of the points were mentioned earlier on, including the definition of circular economy, the need to put on pressure at every stage of the process, including at design stage, which is as important as any stage. The right to repair speaks to that.  We call for a report examining the opportunity that is here. We heard numerous concerns from people operating within that environment in Ireland, be it around insurance or the tax regime. We also call for an examination of a possible scoring system. The Minister of State will be familiar with the arguments around keeping products alive and the other element of product obsolescence. There is huge opportunity to go further here and this is why we propose the amendment.

Amendment No. 31 does the same thing in a long-winded sort of way. This is an issue that came up during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage. Indeed, it may have been one of the recommendations, if I recall correctly. We feel it is appropriate, while understanding the responsibilities and competencies of the agency, that the Minister is defined in legislation and is ultimately accountable.

This is a straightforward amendment that relates to an issue that was raised with us at pre-legislative scrutiny, where it may have arisen as one of the recommendations of the committee. We touched on the issue earlier. The amendment will include food contact materials in which perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, have been used. Amendment No. 39 will just recategorise the items listed. The Minister of State will be familiar with the argument behind the amendments, which are both quite straightforward.

I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will withdraw the amendment with a view to reintroducing it on Report Stage.

The amendment relates to the national food waste prevention strategy, setting targets sector by sector and outlining an approach to reaching the 50% food waste reduction target by 2030 using 2020 food waste figures as a baseline.  Amendment No. 46 relates to a progress report. It is similar to previous amendments. Amendment No. 47 relates to empowerment, while amendment No. 50 relates to annual publication of the strategy and progress report.

Nevertheless, and he has indicated he will make a contribution in this regard, I am concerned there is not enough in primary legislation to detail what will be in the food waste prevention strategy. It may end up weak in terms of targets, accountability and enforceability. The Minister of State has spoken to some of those points but he might reflect on it before Report Stage and, whether in the legislation or in his comments at that point, emphasise the issue.

I will withdraw this amendment and amendment No. 47, both of which are dealt with by a later amendment.

The Minister of State mentioned the issue of proportionality. If these CCTV cameras are intended to monitor blackspots and act as a deterrent to littering or dumping, the fact that there would be the power to leave them in place for five years raises the question as to what sort of deterrent needs to remain in place for five years. Our amendments will reduce the lifespan of the licence to one year, which could then be renewed. An initial period of five years seems excessive. Will the Minister of State outline the advice he has received in that regard?

I will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister of State's comments. However, I ask him to consider our concern. It is a matter of proportionality. I take on board the point that it will be quite arduous to get the licence or authorisation and get the system up and running in the first place. It is a matter of what would be a reasonable timeframe for that to go on for. I ask the Minister of State to consider that.

Whatever about five years or one year for the extinguishing of the scheme, with regard to the in-built review that is to happen no later than five years after the scheme's introduction, perhaps it would be appropriate for that to be more frequent. I would just make that point again.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-07-12 11:00:00+01:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications (Supplementary)	1	I thank the Minister of State for attending today's meeting. For the record, the Opposition has facilitated the legislation on the basis of the urgent nature of the crisis we face regarding the lights going out next winter. I have to say it is a very unsatisfactory process with regard to engagement and information. I have listened to Government Deputies speak about how much information was available. Every time we have had an exchange on this there has been new information and some answers but other questions remain unanswered. I want to make this point to the Minister of State, as I did to the Minister, Deputy Ryan. At a meeting of the transport committee last week I told the Minister the presentation of these as savings is quite the Orwellian move. They are missed targets as they relate to retrofitting.  I have a number of questions. We are dealing with €200 million out of a possible €350 million. Do we know from where we might expect the €150 million to come later in the year? I welcome the fact there is €252 million remaining for the retrofit budget. Will the Minister of State give us some details of what targets will be missed that have given rise to the availability of this funding? The Minister of State has pointed towards the one-stop-shop and community energy targets. Will the Minister of State give us the figures on what the targets were, what will be started and what will be completed by the end of the year? This will give us a sense of the progress we are making on the one-stop-shop and the community energy scheme.  Within this funding will the Minister of State give us an update on the warmer homes scheme? I know the target is 4,800 by the end of the year. I know that at the end of May we had 1,453 done. The Minister of State points towards the objective of getting to 400 a month. Are we at 400 a month? Did we do more than 400 in June? To get us to the target of 4,800 by the end of the year we will need to do an average of 478 a month. Is this another target we will miss by the end of the year? These are the most vulnerable citizens. This brings me back to my original question. Will we have an underspend and money available at the end of the year because we will have missed targets in the warmer homes scheme? I want to register a concern about the approach in government at budget time and announcing very high figures for retrofitting and then spending the rest of the year moving money out of this allocation, whether for the electricity credit or something else.  With regard to the reallocation from the electricity credit underspend my colleague, Senator Boylan, held a session last week on energy poverty. On Second Stage Deputy Smith and I raised concerns about the fact the electricity credit would not be made available to people in halting sites for example. We know there are other multi-unit residences that did not receive the electricity credit. We have €20 million being reallocated from it now. Will the Minister of State tell us how many people in halting sites or multi-unit developments did not receive the electricity credit?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-07-12 11:00:00+01:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications (Supplementary)	2	The Minister of State is saying there will be €23 million from the one-stop-shop and the community energy scheme. The Minister of State has said there is strong demand and that the Department is confident the work will be commenced by the end of the year but it might not be paid. Will the Minister of State give us the figures on what the target was, what will be commenced and what will be completed by the end of the year? I want to flag the point of the additional €150 million. It comes back to the Exchequer and that is fair enough but there is further underspend. My concern is that we will be here in two or three months' time and we will be taking from the warmer homes scheme or another area of real need.  Does the Minister of State have figures for the projects in the one-stop-shop that were targeted to be completed and those that will be started but not completed by the end of the year and the same for the community energy scheme?

A fire or some other incident knocked out capacity there. I presume this tightens an already tight situation.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 12:30:00+01:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications	12	I have a couple of questions. I refer to some of the language around the €200 and its relationship with VAT. To be clear, households can expect to see a reduction of a total of €200 three times. It will be one hundred and eighty-whatever euro plus VAT. It will be a total of €200. The last time around, there was a switch in relation to VAT in the middle of it and people did not see the reduction that they expected to see. Now, it is clear. It will be a total reduction of €200 on three occasions.  In terms of the local authority commitment, we heard from the representative bodies and local authorities. Is it clear what the funding will be allocated towards? Is it staff? Is it the preparation of local authority climate action plans? Is it boots on the ground to deliver on those plans? Is it to populate the local authority climate teams? They had indicated to us that to resource those climate teams might cost in the region of €11 million. What exactly will the funding go towards and deliver in 2023?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 12:30:00+01:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications	13	Will it be spread evenly spread? The Minister has heard me make this point previously. Some local authorities are for a range of reasons more enthusiastic, but also better placed or better resourced initially, to take advantage of these opportunities. Will it be evenly spread or how will the funding be allocated?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	68	Meath East	speeches	English	2022-10-18 12:30:00+01:00	Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications	14	I do not see where the large energy user rebalancing subvention is accounted for. It is a measure to reduce the cost of electricity bills on households. It is a measure the Minister brought in in 2010 and that has been in place up until a couple of weeks ago. According to reports, it involved €600 million on household bills over a decade. Where is that accounted for? When was it lifted? Why was it in place for so long? Will the Minister give us an update on that?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	1	It is for ten minutes. I thank the witnesses.  Has there been any assessment of the impact of the decision not to restrict travel at an earlier stage? There are indications in Britain of the impact of the Cheltenham festival and the Liverpool-Atlético Madrid game. Have we an assessment of these? It strikes me we acted late. We did not lock down or restrict movement early. We imported the virus. Was there an assessment of the impact of, for example, not introducing the passenger locator form as a mandatory measure earlier or having contact tracing added at an earlier stage? I am thinking in terms of Cheltenham but also in terms of the Ireland-Italy rugby game, as well as people returning home from skiing in northern Italy.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	2	I am sorry to interrupt but we do not have an assessment of the impact of our response in terms of travel into and out of the country. It strikes me that other countries have assessed the impact of events in question in terms of the clusters they created. We are trying to assess here our policy response and interventions. It strikes me that it was later when we introduced the mandatory form rather than earlier.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	3	I will move on. I thank Mr. Breslin for the response on-----
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	4	On a related point, on which I am picking up, many have been hearing conflicting messages over the past week or maybe a little longer, be it from public health professionals or representatives of airlines and the airline industry. There is lot of confusion in this regard. People are looking towards the summer holidays and wondering what the landscape will be like. Some have their summer holidays abroad booked. I know people who book almost a year in advance. Some are anxious to get away on their summer holidays. People will be able to travel to Bergamo or Madrid in a couple of weeks if they want. Those areas were very badly affected by Covid-19. What advice is coming from the Department on what the landscape will be like? Can people expect mandatory self-isolation in June, July, August and September in Ireland? What are travellers to expect? What are employers to expect of their employees? What is the position of the Department on that?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	5	It is the case, then, that it will be consistently under review? For those people who booked a family or summer holiday for July or August already, as far as a year back or earlier this year, what protections will there be if their airline is flying at that stage? Will the State give clear advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Health about what areas are safe for non-essential travel and what areas are not safe to travel to?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	6	Additional protections are afforded to consumers and travellers if the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says not to travel to certain countries.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	65	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-02 11:00:00+01:00	Travel Restrictions	7	I have a question for Ms Graham from the NTA about the mandatory wearing of face masks on public transport. It strikes me, travelling through Dublin today, that very few people are wearing face coverings. I do not know if other people have the same experience. We have advice about wearing face masks but it is not mandatory. We nearly have as much information about the exceptions as there is about the wearing of masks themselves. I know that union representatives are looking for mandatory face masks. Will this be considered and introduced immediately?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	1	I thank the witnesses for their presentations and opening statements. I have a question for the three of them separately. Individually, they represent a significant number of members and whether they be hotels, restaurants or pubs, it is a broad range and they can be very different animals despite coming under the same bracket. There seems to be a very low uptake of the financial supports offered by the Government. Is that true across the board in each sector, or have certain categories of hotel, for example, seen greater uptake? Likewise, have certain categories of restaurant or pub responded more favourably?  The witnesses have all raised the issue of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and the particular elements which apply to seasonal workers. Can they expand on the practical implications for seasonal workers? I am conscious that the scheme is based on payrolls from January and February. This may be a quieter time of year for some of the businesses represented here, with fewer staff employed. Could the witnesses speak to those two points?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	2	If this matter has been raised with the Department or the Minister, what sort of response has been received?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	3	I am conscious of time. Has the Irish Hoteliers Federation noticed a difference between hoteliers, for example, where the uptake of various grants and supports within the sector is concerned?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	4	I thank Mr. Fenn for his reply. Can Mr. Cummins also come in on the wage subsidy scheme and differences among restaurateurs in the sector?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	5	It is the same experience.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-06-30 11:00:00+01:00	Impact of Covid-19: Hospitality Sector	6	I will move on to discuss price and affordability because I am conscious of the time limit. It was mentioned in the earlier session that the previous crisis was one of debt and that this crisis is one of confidence. Sinn Féin launched a proposal last week to stimulate demand within the tourism and hospitality sector through the issuance of vouchers for each individual and family across the country. Some of the responses we got referred to the issue of affordability within the Irish tourism and hospitality sector. Some people said that they can holiday in Spain far cheaper than they can in Ireland and gave examples of very expensive hotels, holiday homes and that sort of thing. The sector is requesting a lot of the State. What measures will be taken within it to tackle that issue of affordability and to ensure that fair value is available to consumers?

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on International Travel	2	On the prospective scale of job losses Mr. McGowan mentioned a tsunami. I ask him to give us a sense of the number of job losses that might be on the horizon if we stay on the current trajectory and with the current level of intervention from the Government.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on International Travel	3	I thank Mr. McGowan. Moving to the issue of the health and safety of workers, the submissions outline the really important work that is being done in terms of bringing our people home and transporting essential goods. Is there any information of clusters of positive cases among airlines or people working in the aviation sector that might indicate they were at increased risk of exposure to Covid-19?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on International Travel	4	What about workers more generally in the aviation sector?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on International Travel	5	Does Mr. McGowan have an exact figure on the positive cases at Dublin Airport?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on International Travel	6	We wish them well in their recovery and thank them for all the important work they do.  On the challenge for the sector overall, I take the points made about Ireland being an outlier but it strikes me that there is a fundamental conflict between the wishes for public health when NPHET has been very clear in its requests here, and the interests of the aviation sector more generally around the issue of movement. It is clear that the single greatest tool we have in our fight against Covid-19 is quarantine and the restriction on movement. Aviation is the exact opposite of this, regardless of what might be said on the evidence base. It is a question of the lack of quality of our evidence base rather than it not existing. The virus is spread by the movement of people and the aviation sector and travel involves such movement. That challenge must be squared. The Government seems not to have persuaded people of the model it is proposing. I believe there is a lack of confidence among communities and even within Government. Given that we have we have the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, data, we have European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, guidelines, will Mr. Cullen outline what model he would like to see implemented? Is it testing and tracing at airports with an all-Ireland approach? What would going through an airport look like? As far as I can see there is no mandatory wearing of masks in Dublin Airport, or it is certainly not implemented. Reference was made to the passenger locator form as being quite inadequate. I agree with Mr. Cullen there. What model would Mr. Cullen envisage that would give confidence to people in Ireland that the system is working here and that the people who come through the system and others are not being put at risk?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport	1	I thank Mr. O'Leary, Mr. Waldron and Mr. Macken for their presentations. I also thank them for their work and that of the people they represent on the front line.  I have a question for Mr. O'Leary and Mr. Macken. In terms of the supports they believe are needed for the taxi industry, what is the scale of the subsidies that are needed? What form should they take? Should it be grants or loans? Reference was made to the continuation of the wage subsidy scheme.  What is the response of the witnesses to the July stimulus package that was announced yesterday? Does it adequately address the needs of the sector?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport	2	Out of interest, does Mr. Waldron know how many taxi drivers are over the age of 66 and, thereby, not eligible for the Covid payment? They may be in a more difficult position in terms of weighing up whether they should be back at work.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport	3	I wish to ask about the experience of the witnesses in dealing with the NTA and the Department. We have a new Minister 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport	4	Mr. Macken and Mr. Waldron both mentioned challenges as they relate to the operation of taxis at Dublin Airport. Will they expand on that, outlining the current circumstances, how Covid has affected them, and what they believe needs to happen in that regard?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	1	I am keeping an eye on the clock. I have a number of questions arising out of issues that have presented over time but I also wish to address some matters that arose during this morning's deliberations. I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  There is deep concern that our ports and airports are gateways for further import of Covid-19 and that they will increase the risk of the spread of the virus in the community. We heard from some representatives this morning, including the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, that the gold standard was testing and tracing. I ask the witnesses to outline what models have been assessed for our ports and airports in that regard. All the measures, checks and controls laid out in A Protocol for the Management of Air Passengers in light of COVID-19 and COVID-19 agreed protocol for International Ro-Ro Passenger Transport Services, Ports & Terminal Service Operators, the documents published for the air and marine sectors earlier this week, are self-declaratory in nature. I ask the witnesses to address that point. The fact that there are no diagnostic or third-party checks or controls at our ports and airports causes great concern for people generally. That is an important point, particularly since many people are asymptomatic but carry and transmit Covid-19 during that period. We do not have temperature screening, antibody tests or DNA tests, which are often part of the response in other countries. I would like the witnesses to address that, if possible. 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	2	I thank Mr. Towey for that response. I will make a point about the low passenger numbers at this point in time. My sense is that the challenge at the moment is not what it might be in the future. This morning we heard a strong case for a relaxation of restrictions, and we do not know where we are in the development of a vaccine. We may be some months living with Covid-19. We will have to consider our approach in terms of our checks and controls at our airports in particular but also at our ports. Is it the case that the protocol is being actively reviewed in the context of the incoming numbers? Could the witnesses give me a little more detail on the immediate plans in response to the green list as they relate to the passenger locator form and the call centre that was mentioned earlier? The figures that were reported during the week for those filling out the passenger locator form, the follow-up calls and the number of people who answered do not inspire confidence. It is really important that people have confidence in the systems we have in place. Whether the small numbers coming from the United States, the small numbers coming from Germany or someone coming from a green list country, it is important that people are assessed for their risk and followed up on.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	5	That is no problem. I am watching the clock myself.  Representatives from the taxi sector appeared before the committee this morning. They outlined a deep sense of frustration in their industry and how it has been affected by Covid-19 and with the supports from Government. One issue they raised was engagement with the NTA and, to a lesser extent, I think, the Department and the Minister. Issues with the taxi advisory committee were raised. Will the Department engage with the taxi sector? More generally, how does the Department propose to address and engage with the concerns that have been raised? I am sure the witnesses will have access to the submissions that were made earlier. There is deep concern within the sector. Many of those in the sector are highly vulnerable workers who have been forced, through the way in which the system was set up, to work through the Covid period despite being quite vulnerable.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	6	What form did the Minister's meeting take? Was it with the taxi advisory committee or was it more general?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	7	I thank Ms Hanlon. I welcome the fact that there has been engagement, but in addition to the assessment, it is fair to say that a question arose in our earlier session in terms of the representativeness of the taxi advisory committee. I ask that the witnesses engage in a full and comprehensive way with the groups we met earlier. I do not know the exact detail in terms of the make-up, but the principle of comprehensive engagement is an important one and I ask that they make that effort.  My final question is on a separate issue related to Ms Hanlon's Department. An issue has arisen around full driving licences and people being caught since the start of this month with driving licences expiring and being unable to get an extension or an appointment for a renewal. They have been left in a legal limbo in terms of insurance and being able to drive. Will someone outline to me the immediate action that will be taken to address that anomaly, which I and a number of colleagues raised in the Dáil this week?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-24 09:35:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Public Transport (Resumed)	8	Yes. I thank Mr. Spratt. I will conclude and I thank the witnesses for their contributions.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	1	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I want to come back to the revelation at the weekend that the Government is using people's travel history against them when it comes to social welfare and that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has been cut for some people who travel abroad based on assessments taking place in the airports. Is it the case that those assessments are taking place not only at Dublin but also at Cork, Shannon and elsewhere? 
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	2	Is Mr. Gray aware that such checks are taking place? Has the DAA been notified in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	3	Does Mr. Gray not know, then, when those checks might have started, on what basis, what type of information is being collected or the type of activity that is happening in the airports that the DAA is responsible for?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	4	Who does Mr. Gray think might be well placed to assist me?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	5	Does the same apply at Shannon Airport and our other regional airports?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	6	To return to the DAA, I appreciate it does not collect data itself but it is aware that it is reported that data is being collected. What is the extent to which it is aware of activities taking place in the airports it is responsible for? It is very strange that the DAA would not be aware of this activity and it raises the question of what other activities it might not be aware of in our airports.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	7	Has the DAA any responsibility for other parties that might be collecting GDPR-sensitive data in the airport? Should the DAA be notified that such activity was ongoing?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	8	How does the DAA ensure that individuals or agencies are not illegally collecting the information of citizens of Ireland or elsewhere on their property?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	9	Okay. I will move on to the issue of airport checks and controls. In his opening statement Mr. Gray referred to the possibility that people might be required to take a Covid-19 test 72 or fewer hours before travelling and submit proof of a negative result prior to travel. We had the Department with us on Friday and they raised the prospect of a testing facility at the airport. There was a motion on the draft schedule for the Dáil on Friday but it has since been removed and a motion relating to prefabs or temporary structures being put in at the airport was substituted in its position.  A number of countries across Europe have a requirement for testing and being able to provide proof of a negative result. Is it the immediate intention of the DAA to proceed with a testing regime at the airport or what are the DAA's plans in that regard?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	10	It should be taken that with every intervention we make there is risk associated with false positives and negatives. It is very clear at the minute that the regime of checks and controls that we have at our ports and airports inspires zero confidence in the public. That, in and of itself, is a problem. It contributes to the difficulty of having a conversation about what future travel might look like in the context of living with Covid-19. What type of model should the Government be working towards, from Mr. Gray's perspective? Is it one that involves mandatory or random, antibody or DNA testing or one that involves increased tracking and tracing and isolation or quarantine? I would appreciate it if he could give us the best exemplar we should be looking toward.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation	11	I mean that specifically in regard to the passenger locator form. There were figures announced about it last week. It is not an alarming thing to say, and I mean that with due respect. It is my opinion that the systems we have in place are not fit for purpose.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	1	I will pick up on that point. I thank Mr. Doyle and Mr. Wilson for their presentations. Could they outline the number of refunds that have been issued to date, the number of refunds that have yet to be issued, the number of vouchers issued and the number yet to be issued? Could they provide assurances to customers who are still waiting that they will receive those vouchers? The Irish Travel Agents Association estimates that consumer losses are at €800,000 per day. This represents seats that were bought but not used and not refunded. Have the witnesses produced an estimate of this themselves or do they agree with that figure? Has there been any change to rescheduling fees? Very many people are reporting exorbitant charges for rescheduling?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	2	Mr. Doyle made a comment with regard to refunds. Can he give the same assurance to people who are waiting for vouchers that they will receive them?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	3	Could Mr. Wilson answer my question?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	4	Can I ask about rescheduling fees as applied during the Covid-19 period? Is there a change in policy compared to previous times?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	5	I thank Mr. Doyle and Mr. Wilson for their responses. I encourage full engagement with customers because I know there is a lot of frustration in respect of those issues. I take the point about Ireland being an outlier but I have a list of 44 countries in Europe in front of me and no two have the same approach to checks and controls at airports. There are restrictions and a wide range of variation in terms of testing, tracing and quarantine. Is there a specific country whose model the witnesses believe Ireland should be following? Is there an exemplar? A one-word answer will do.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-07-28 09:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Impact on Aviation (resumed)	6	Does Mr. Doyle agree with the idea of Germany as a model?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-08-13 10:00:00+01:00	Covid 19: Implications of a Zero-Covid Island Policy	1	I thank each of the expert witnesses. It is great to have them here and to have their insights. I will start with a question for Professors Kearney and Staines. In presenting this zero-Covid strategy the witnesses have said it is backed by science, experience and extensive analysis. With regard to experience, are there examples of where this has been done? Is New Zealand an example or are there other places where it has been done successfully? In practical terms, what would be the implications for people in Ireland if we were to pursue this strategy? One of the aspects that received a lot of coverage was the nature of life in New Zealand, for example, where there are large gatherings of people. Would that be the case in Ireland if we pursued this successfully? For example, would pubs be allowed to reopen? Would we have large music events and that type of thing? How would life of on a practical basis be different for people in Ireland if we pursued this strategy successfully?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-08-13 10:00:00+01:00	Covid 19: Implications of a Zero-Covid Island Policy	2	A point was raised by Mr. O'Brien earlier in argument to the approach. It is the argument we hear regularly in opposition to this approach, including from the former Taoiseach and now Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, which is that Ireland is not like New Zealand. We are much closer physically, geographically and economically to our nearest neighbours, Europe and the United States. Our economy is a very different one from New Zealand's. How would the witnesses address the interconnected nature of Irish society and our economy compared with other places? Where does a zero-Covid policy end? Is it like everything else and must go on until a vaccine is found? I ask Professors Kearney and Staines to discuss the interconnected nature of the Irish economy.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-08-13 10:00:00+01:00	Covid 19: Implications of a Zero-Covid Island Policy	3	I thank Professor Staines. I will move on to my next question. I take it from Professor Heneghan's contributions that he has a different opinion on the zero-Covid approach. Given that he works in the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and has done a lot of work on evidence synthesis, does he advocate an alternative approach and what would that approach be?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-08-13 10:00:00+01:00	Covid 19: Implications of a Zero-Covid Island Policy	4	I thank Professor Heneghan for that response. I have a final question for Professor Kearney. There is a lot of agreement on the need for testing capacity to be improved and to have rapid and flexible testing. We currently have unused testing capacity. I am inclined to think that is an inappropriate position to be in but does Professor Kearney have a sense of the type of testing capacity that would be required and how frequently specific cohorts would require to be tested and retested?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-08-13 10:00:00+01:00	Covid 19: Implications of a Zero-Covid Island Policy	5	That is not the case with the cases in a crèche in County Meath. I know people involved who had to wait more than a week to have the test and contract tracing done and to get results back. That is completely unsatisfactory in a relatively quiet time in terms of demand on the system. It is something we can all agree we need to improve. I thank the witnesses for their responses and contributions.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	1	I thank the witnesses for their contributions today. I will continue in the same vein as the Chairman because it is an area of interest. The issue of foreign travel is particularly contentious in Ireland, and this follows on from the previous questions and the witnesses' responses. Ireland has a green list. A similar traffic light system is in operation in other countries across Europe and the world. We have Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advices and guidelines from the Government. In the international experience, what is the legal basis for such restrictions? Are there legal bases in other countries that do not apply in Ireland? Where do the witnesses believe that improvements can be made?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	2	I ask Dr. Buquicchio to comment on the international and European experience of the legal basis for the restriction of movement of people across borders and the introduction of green lists and red lists?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	3	Are there examples in Britain or in Europe of legal challenges being brought against Governments by individual citizens, corporations, airlines or businesses in the aviation or tourism sectors in respect of the restrictions that have been applied around freedom of movement and travel, especially across international borders?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	4	Will Mr. Buquicchio comment on the international experience?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	5	I wish to discuss a separate point and move off foreign travel. The challenge of striking the balance between public health considerations and economic, social and other considerations, including mental health and educational needs, is consistently raised. In Ireland, the Government is advised from a public health perspective by the National Public Health Emergency Team. In Britain, the Government is advised by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Can the witnesses offer an opinion or point to international examples of how other bodies or decision-making forums are used to help inform government decision-making? Are there models that incorporate opinions other than public health advice that the witnesses can offer as an alternative? Can we start with Mr. Sumption?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	6	Can Dr. Buquicchio point to international examples of advisory models that inform Government decision-making?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-09 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Legislative Framework Underpinning the State's Response	7	I have a final question for both speakers in regard to the legal basis for testing regimes and, it is hoped, in the not too distant future, vaccination regimes. What is the international experience of the legal basis for testing regimes as it applies during the Covid pandemic? The witnesses will probably have some experience of some regimes from certain quarters or of questions being raised in regard to bodily integrity and such issues.

Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	1	"I will move quickly into questions for Dr. McConkey. I am interested in samples that are tested. We get results back stating the virus is ""not detected"". Is there a result stating there is insufficient sample? I want to know more about sample quality. I know from my experience in laboratories in testing solid tumours that we can identify if a tumour is present. Then we can run it or amplify it and we can see genetic material. Does an ""insufficient sample"" result ever come back?"
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	2	"Is it correct to say they are separate things? One is a process failure. If the controls and the process run well but the sample is empty, for example, will it return an ""insufficient sample"" result?"
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	3	My follow-up question is about the sample integrity in the swab. How long is a sample viable? I am mindful that some people are getting swabs taken and maybe have to wait for a couple of days before the sample is analysed. Do we know how long the samples are viable?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	4	Will Dr. McConkey estimate for how many days the sample would be viable and its integrity maintained in the swab?
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	5	We have had much discussion on the testing strategy. Talk has shifted from 100,000 tests a week, the criteria were extended too much and the focus shifted from certain risk groups to others. For example, last week we took focus away from meat plants to test my two and a half year old who was very low risk . If the witnesses were to design a testing strategy for Ireland, what would it look like? Dr. McConkey might begin.
Darren O'Rourke	Sinn Fein	66	Meath East	speeches	English	2020-09-23 10:00:00+01:00	Covid-19: Strategic Options for Government Plan to Eliminate Community Transmission	6	Will Dr. Ryan also comment on the testing strategy and refer to the Government's plan for living with Covid and its commitment to recruit medical scientists, contact tracers and people for taking swabs? Is it sufficient or comprehensive enough?
