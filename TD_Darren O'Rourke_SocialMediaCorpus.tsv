They have a complete lack of vision and ambition for our county. Deliver Navan Rail...and start NOW!!!  Tune in if you can. https://t.co/lhn956l5M7
1616047537810554880	2023-01-19 12:18:52+00:00	It’s important for activist groups to be able to cut through political bluster. This is a simple matter.   It’s about funding and it’s about priorities. Is your project a priority and is it funded?  For this Govt. Navan rail is a lesser priority and it’s not funded. https://t.co/ckY2dP0L5Q
1616048368912068610	2023-01-19 12:22:10+00:00	These are Govt’s priorities for 22-30. There’s movement on every one of these NOW or imminent. To deliver beyond that requires extra commitment and funding. For our part, SF has committed to 2 additional projects - Navan Rail and Western Rail Corridor. https://t.co/U74RxtgG5s
1616050331544322049	2023-01-19 12:29:58+00:00	@EM_Creative Incrementalism, Ed! We need radical reform in public and active transport but Govt is going little beyond business as usual. Take it as a given that there will be hurdles in planning and delivery (we can do better e.g. by resourcing the planning system) but we haven’t even hit
1616051796891545600	2023-01-19 12:35:47+00:00	@EM_Creative the starting line for Navan Rail. The longer it takes to get to starting line the greater risk that it’ll be delayed further along the way (like Metrolink).
1616051932379897856	2023-01-19 12:36:20+00:00	@EM_Creative All this at a time of binding legal emissions reductions targets - and a €5bn budget surplus! Important to note the Aecom report set out an 8 year schedule for the project in terms of planning and cost. https://t.co/EOCQOmjKR1
1616090243366633472	2023-01-19 15:08:34+00:00	@EM_Creative @finnegan_barry Essential to start design &amp; planning now. Any delay will delay whole project. Per NTA &amp; Aecom whole project should take 8-10 years including up to 5 years construction - so 2031 to 2033 if we started today. 2036 and no guarantee of funding is not a win IMO. Need to keep pushing.
1616127219889491969	2023-01-19 17:35:30+00:00	🚂 Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael think 2036 is time enough for Navan Rail. Oh, and they haven’t allocated funding to the project!!  The only way Meath will push on is if we get rid of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Sinn Féin would start the Navan Rail project TODAY. #Time4Change https://t.co/Zh7Brj9oAX

Sinn Féin will do MORE. Specifically, in this round of the NDP - Navan Rail and the Western Rail Corridor. We've made that commitment publicly and repeatedly.
1618188951910764546	2023-01-25 10:08:05+00:00	@DublinCommuters @NavanCycling I'm not suggesting that construction will start now. Under Sinn Féin, the Navan Rail project would start now (planning and design) &amp; continue, uninterrupted, to construction &amp; delivery. By allocating more funding to NDP, FF/FG/Greens could make same commitment...but haven't.

1623816569909391360	2023-02-09 22:50:13+00:00	Meath has the lowest number of Gardaí per head of population. That has to change!  Thanks to everyone who attended the public meeting tonight.   We have a lack of Garda resources in our county. This needs to be addressed by the Justice Minister &amp; Garda Commissioner. https://t.co/OxFlB1Xe3M
